## What It Is

An affirmative defense is a legal argument that says, in effect: "Even if everything you say is true, I still win because of [some additional legal reason]." Unlike a regular defense (which attacks your facts or legal theory), an affirmative defense introduces **new matter** that defeats your claim.

In § 1983 cases, affirmative defenses are powerful tools defendants use to avoid liability — and several of them are case-killers if you're not prepared.

## The Defendant's Burden

Here's the good news: the defendant must **raise** affirmative defenses in their [answer](/primer/answer) to your complaint, and they bear the **burden of proving** them. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(c), if the defendant doesn't raise an affirmative defense in their answer, they generally waive it.

This means you should **read the defendant's answer carefully** to see what defenses they've raised.

## Common Affirmative Defenses in § 1983 Cases

### Qualified Immunity

The most common and most devastating defense. [Qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) shields government officials from liability unless they violated a [clearly established](/primer/clearly-established-law) constitutional right. The defendant argues either (1) no constitutional violation occurred, or (2) the law wasn't clearly established at the time.

### Statute of Limitations

Your claim must be filed within the applicable [statute of limitations](/primer/statute-of-limitations). In § 1983 cases, the deadline is borrowed from your state's personal injury statute — typically 2-3 years. Miss it, and your case is dead.

### Heck Doctrine

Under [Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/117817/heck-v-humphrey/), if winning your § 1983 case would imply that your criminal conviction was invalid, your claim is barred until the conviction is reversed. See [Heck doctrine](/primer/heck-doctrine).

### Absolute Immunity

Certain officials — judges, prosecutors acting in their prosecutorial capacity, legislators — have [absolute immunity](/primer/absolute-immunity) and cannot be sued under § 1983 for actions within their official functions, no matter how egregious.

### Failure to Exhaust (Prisoners)

Under the [Prison Litigation Reform Act](/primer/plra), prisoners must exhaust all available administrative remedies (grievance procedures) before filing a § 1983 lawsuit.

### Res Judicata / Collateral Estoppel

If the same issue or claim was already decided in a prior proceeding, the defendant may argue you can't relitigate it. See [collateral estoppel](/primer/collateral-estoppel).

## How to Respond

When the defendant raises affirmative defenses:

1. **Identify which defenses actually apply** — Defendants often list every conceivable defense as boilerplate. Many won't be relevant.
2. **Research the elements** — Each defense has specific requirements the defendant must prove.
3. **Gather contrary evidence** — For qualified immunity, show the law was clearly established. For statute of limitations, argue [tolling](/primer/tolling).
4. **Challenge waived defenses** — If a defense wasn't raised in the answer, argue it's waived.

## Key Cases

- [Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/117817/heck-v-humphrey/) — Favorable-termination requirement when § 1983 claim challenges conviction
- [Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 (1982)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110863/harlow-v-fitzgerald/) — Established the modern qualified immunity standard
- [Gomez v. Toledo, 446 U.S. 635 (1980)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110297/gomez-v-toledo/) — Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense; defendant bears the burden
