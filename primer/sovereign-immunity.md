## What It Is

Sovereign immunity is the ancient legal principle that **the government cannot be sued without its consent**. In the United States, this doctrine primarily protects **states** (not cities or counties) from being hauled into court.

The [Eleventh Amendment](/primer/eleventh-amendment) enshrines this protection in the Constitution, barring lawsuits against a state in federal court by its own citizens or citizens of other states.

## How It Affects § 1983 Cases

Sovereign immunity has a major impact:

- **States are not "persons" under § 1983.** The Supreme Court held in [Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U.S. 58 (1989)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112271/will-v-michigan-dept-of-state-police/) that a state and its agencies cannot be sued for damages under § 1983.
- **State officials sued in their [official capacity](/primer/official-capacity)** are really suits against the state itself, so they are also barred for damages.
- **Cities and counties are NOT protected.** Municipal governments are "persons" under § 1983 and can be sued. See [Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/).

## The Workarounds

You cannot sue a state for damages under § 1983, but you have options:

1. **Sue the individual officer** in their **personal capacity** for damages. Sovereign immunity does not protect individuals acting on their own behalf.
2. **Sue a state official in official capacity for injunctive relief** under the [Ex parte Young](/primer/ex-parte-young) doctrine. You can ask a court to order a state official to stop violating the Constitution going forward.
3. **Sue the city or county** under [Monell liability](/primer/monell-liability) if a municipal policy or custom caused the violation.

## Congress and Sovereign Immunity

Congress can override sovereign immunity in limited circumstances by using its power under the Fourteenth Amendment. However, the Supreme Court held that § 1983 itself does **not** abrogate state sovereign immunity. [Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332 (1979)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110052/quern-v-jordan/).

## Practical Tips

- **Do not name the state or a state agency** as a defendant in a § 1983 damages claim — it will be dismissed.
- **Name individual officers** in their personal capacity for damages.
- **If you need to change state policy**, use the [Ex parte Young](/primer/ex-parte-young) doctrine to seek an injunction against the responsible state official.
- **Cities, counties, and local agencies** do not have sovereign immunity under § 1983.

## Key Takeaway

States are immune from § 1983 damages suits. Focus your claims on individual officers (personal capacity) and municipalities, or seek injunctive relief against state officials under Ex parte Young.
