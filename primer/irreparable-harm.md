## What It Is

Irreparable harm means injury that **cannot be adequately compensated by money damages** after the fact. It is one of the key requirements for obtaining [injunctive relief](/primer/injunctive-relief) — including [temporary restraining orders](/primer/tro) and [preliminary injunctions](/primer/preliminary-injunction).

The logic is straightforward: courts generally prefer to let cases play out and award money at the end. But when money can't undo the damage — because the harm is ongoing, because a right will be permanently lost, or because the injury can't be quantified — a court may step in with an order to stop the harmful conduct now.

## What Qualifies as Irreparable Harm

In § 1983 cases, courts have recognized irreparable harm in situations including:

- **Loss of constitutional rights** — The Supreme Court has held that "the loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury." [Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109506/elrod-v-burns/). This principle extends to other constitutional rights.
- **Ongoing unconstitutional conditions** — Dangerous jail or prison conditions threatening your health or life
- **Destruction of evidence** — Once evidence is gone, it's gone
- **Threats to physical safety** — Continued police harassment or retaliation
- **Loss of unique property** — Something that can't be replaced with money

## What Doesn't Qualify

- **Financial losses** that can be calculated and repaid later
- **Speculative or hypothetical future harm** — You need to show the harm is **likely**, not just possible
- **Past harm** — Irreparable harm must be **ongoing or imminent**. If the bad conduct already happened and stopped, you seek money damages instead.

## The Standard

You must show that irreparable harm is **likely in the absence of an injunction** — not merely possible. The Supreme Court emphasized this in [Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 555 U.S. 7 (2008)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/145893/winter-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/): a mere "possibility" of irreparable harm is not enough.

## Practical Tips for Pro Se Litigants

When arguing irreparable harm in your motion:

- **Be specific** — Don't just say "I'll be harmed." Explain exactly what will happen if the court doesn't act.
- **Show urgency** — Why can't this wait for a full trial?
- **Explain why money isn't enough** — What makes this harm impossible to undo with a dollar amount?
- **Provide evidence** — Attach declarations, photos, medical records, or other documents showing the harm is real and imminent.

## Key Cases

- [Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109506/elrod-v-burns/) — Loss of First Amendment rights is per se irreparable harm
- [Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7 (2008)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/145893/winter-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/) — Irreparable harm must be "likely," not just "possible"
- [Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922 (1975)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109358/doran-v-salem-inn-inc/) — Showing of irreparable harm required for preliminary injunctive relief
