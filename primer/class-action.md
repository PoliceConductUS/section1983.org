## What It Is

A class action under Federal Rule 23 allows one or more named plaintiffs to sue on behalf of a larger group ("class") of people who suffered similar harm. In § 1983, class actions have been used to challenge systemic police practices affecting entire communities.

## Requirements for Certification

Under Rule 23(a), you must show:

1. **Numerosity** — The class is so large that joining all members individually is impracticable
2. **Commonality** — There are questions of law or fact common to the class
3. **Typicality** — The named plaintiff's claims are typical of the class
4. **Adequacy** — The named plaintiff will fairly and adequately represent the class

Plus, you must fit one of the Rule 23(b) categories:

- **(b)(1)** — Individual actions would create inconsistent obligations for the defendant
- **(b)(2)** — The defendant acted on grounds generally applicable to the class (most common in § 1983 — used for injunctive relief)
- **(b)(3)** — Common questions predominate and class action is the superior method (used for damages)

## In § 1983 Cases

Class actions are most common for:

- **Stop-and-frisk policies** — Floyd v. City of New York challenged NYPD's blanket stop-and-frisk practices
- **Jail conditions** — Systemic overcrowding, inadequate medical care, excessive force
- **Immigration enforcement** — Unconstitutional detention practices
- **School discipline** — Discriminatory suspension or expulsion policies

## Pro Se Class Actions

Technically, a pro se plaintiff can file a class action. Practically, courts almost never certify a class represented by a pro se plaintiff because the adequacy requirement demands competent representation. If you believe a class action is warranted, contact organizations like the [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org) or [NPAP](https://www.nlg-npap.org) that handle systemic civil rights litigation.
