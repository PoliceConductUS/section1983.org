## What It Is

An individual capacity suit (also called a "personal capacity" suit) targets the government official **as a person**. You're saying: "You, Officer Smith, personally violated my rights, and you should personally pay for it."

If you win, the damages come from the officer (or, more typically, from the government's indemnification policy or insurance — but legally, it's the officer's liability).

## Why It Matters

Individual capacity suits are the primary vehicle for money damages in § 1983 cases. Unlike [official capacity](/primer/official-capacity) suits (which are really suits against the government entity), individual capacity suits can yield compensatory and punitive damages against the specific officers who violated your rights.

But there's a tradeoff: individual capacity defendants can raise [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity). Official capacity defendants can't (because QI is a personal defense, and the government entity doesn't get it).

## How to Plead It

**State it explicitly.** If your complaint doesn't specify individual or official capacity, courts may presume official capacity — which in the case of state officials means your damages claim gets blocked by the [Eleventh Amendment](/primer/eleventh-amendment).

Best practice: "Defendant Officer Smith is sued in both his individual and official capacities." But understand what each means:

- **Individual** → money damages, but QI applies
- **Official** → injunctive relief, no QI, but no money damages against state officials

## Indemnification

In practice, officers rarely pay out of their own pockets. Cities and counties indemnify their officers in the vast majority of § 1983 judgments and settlements. But the legal fiction matters: the lawsuit is against the individual, which makes QI available as a defense.
