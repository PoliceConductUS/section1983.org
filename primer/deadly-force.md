## What It Is

Deadly force is force that is likely to cause death or serious bodily harm — most commonly shooting a firearm, but it can also include chokeholds, vehicle strikes, or taser use in certain circumstances. The [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment) places strict limits on when officers may use deadly force, because killing or gravely injuring someone is the most extreme form of [seizure](/primer/seizure).

## The Garner Rule

In [Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111388/tennessee-v-garner/), the Supreme Court struck down a Tennessee law that allowed police to shoot any fleeing suspect. The Court held that deadly force is a seizure under the Fourth Amendment and may only be used when:

1. The officer has **probable cause to believe** the suspect poses a **significant threat of death or serious physical injury** to the officer or others, AND
2. The force is **reasonably necessary** to prevent escape (when applicable)

The officer must reasonably believe the suspect is dangerous — not merely fleeing. Shooting an unarmed person running from a minor offense is unconstitutional.

## The Graham Framework Still Applies

Deadly force claims are analyzed under the same [Graham v. Connor](/primer/graham-factors) "objective reasonableness" standard as other excessive force claims. Courts consider the totality of the circumstances, including:

- **The severity of the crime** at issue
- **Whether the suspect posed an immediate threat** to officers or others
- **Whether the suspect was actively resisting or attempting to evade arrest**

The most important factor is almost always the **immediacy of the threat**. Courts will look at what the officer knew at the moment force was used — not what was discovered later.

## Common Issues in Deadly Force Cases

- **"I thought they had a gun"** — Officers often claim they perceived a weapon. The question is whether that perception was **objectively reasonable** given the circumstances.
- **Shooting into vehicles** — Many departments prohibit this because moving cars are hard to stop with bullets and bystanders are at risk. Violating department policy doesn't prove a constitutional violation, but it's relevant evidence.
- **Shooting people in mental health crisis** — Officers who immediately resort to deadly force without attempting de-escalation may face liability, though circuit courts vary on whether de-escalation is constitutionally required.
- **The "created danger" question** — Some courts consider whether the officer recklessly created the dangerous situation that led to the shooting, though this varies by circuit.

## Qualified Immunity Challenges

Deadly force cases often hinge on [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity). Defendants argue there's no [clearly established law](/primer/clearly-established-law) matching the specific facts. Courts have sometimes required near-identical factual precedent, making these cases difficult. However, _Garner_ itself clearly establishes that shooting an unarmed, non-dangerous fleeing suspect is unconstitutional.

## Key Cases

- [Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111388/tennessee-v-garner/) — Deadly force limited to dangerous suspects; can't shoot any fleeing person
- [Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/) — Objective reasonableness standard for all excessive force claims
- [Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372 (2007)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/145726/scott-v-harris/) — Ramming a fleeing car was reasonable given the danger of the high-speed chase
- [Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U.S. 765 (2014)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2684092/plumhoff-v-rickard/) — Shooting to end a dangerous car chase did not violate the Fourth Amendment
