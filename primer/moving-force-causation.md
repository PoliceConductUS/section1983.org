## What It Is

Moving force causation is the **causation requirement** for [municipal liability](/primer/municipal-liability) under [Monell](/primer/monell-liability). It is not enough to show that a city had a bad policy _and_ that you suffered a constitutional violation. You must prove the policy **directly caused** your injury — that it was the "moving force" behind the violation.

The Supreme Court established this standard in [Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/) and reinforced it in [Board of County Commissioners v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397 (1997)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118142/bd-of-commrs-of-bryan-cty-v-brown/).

## What You Must Show

Moving force causation has two parts:

1. **But-for causation** — The violation would not have occurred without the city's policy, custom, or [failure to train](/primer/failure-to-train).

2. **Proximate causation** — The connection between the policy and the violation must be close and direct, not remote or attenuated. [Board of County Commissioners v. Brown](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118142/bd-of-commrs-of-bryan-cty-v-brown/).

## Examples

**Strong causation:**

- A city has an explicit policy allowing officers to use chokeholds during routine arrests. An officer applies a chokehold and injures you. The policy was the moving force.
- A department has **zero training** on how to interact with people experiencing mental health crises. An untrained officer uses deadly force against a person in crisis. The [training failure](/primer/failure-to-train) was the moving force.

**Weak causation:**

- A city has a generally lax disciplinary culture, but the officer who harmed you acted in a way completely unrelated to any policy gap. The connection is too attenuated.
- A city negligently hired an officer who later committed a random, unforeseeable act. In [Board of County Commissioners v. Brown](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118142/bd-of-commrs-of-bryan-cty-v-brown/), the Court found this insufficient without a more direct link.

## Why It Matters

Moving force causation is where many [Monell](/primer/monell-liability) claims fail. Plaintiffs can often identify a bad policy, but struggle to prove it **caused their specific injury** rather than being a background condition.

## Practical Tips

- **Draw a direct line** from the policy to your injury. Explain step by step how the policy led to the officer's specific conduct that harmed you.
- **Use the policy's own language.** If the policy authorized or encouraged the exact type of conduct that violated your rights, quote it.
- **Show the training gap matches the harm.** For [failure-to-train](/primer/failure-to-train) claims, show that the missing training directly relates to the type of violation you experienced.
- **Expert witnesses** can help establish that proper policies or training would have prevented the incident.
- **Gather evidence of similar incidents.** A pattern of the same type of violation under the same policy strengthens the causal connection.

## Key Takeaway

Identifying a bad policy is not enough — you must prove that policy was the driving force behind your specific constitutional injury. Draw a clear, direct line from policy to harm.
