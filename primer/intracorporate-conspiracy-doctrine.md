The intracorporate conspiracy doctrine says that employees of a single entity are legally incapable of conspiring with each other when they're acting within the scope of their employment. The theory is that a corporation — or a police department — is one legal "person," and a person can't conspire with itself.

## Why This Matters for § 1983 Cases

Many police misconduct cases involve multiple officers from the same department coordinating to violate someone's rights. You'd think that's a textbook conspiracy. But under this doctrine, defendants will argue that officers in the same department can't form a conspiracy because they're all agents of the same municipal employer.

This defense comes up in both [§ 1983 conspiracy claims](/primer/section-1983-conspiracy) and [§ 1985(3) claims](/primer/section-1985).

## How Courts Have Split

Not every circuit applies this doctrine the same way, and some have carved out important exceptions:

**Circuits that apply it broadly:**

- The Fifth Circuit has generally applied the doctrine to § 1985(3) claims against officers in the same department.
- The Eleventh Circuit has applied it in some contexts.

**Circuits that limit or reject it:**

- Several circuits recognize a **personal stake exception** — if an officer had an independent personal motivation (like covering up their own misconduct), they can be treated as acting outside their employment role and thus capable of conspiring.
- Some circuits hold the doctrine doesn't apply to § 1983 conspiracy claims at all, only to § 1985(3).
- The scope exception: officers acting **outside** the scope of their employment can conspire even under the doctrine.

## How to Fight It

If defendants raise the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine, you have several arguments:

**1. The personal stake exception.** Argue that the officers had independent personal motivations — protecting themselves from discipline, covering up their own excessive force, retaliating for personal reasons. When officers act to serve their own interests rather than the department's, many courts hold the doctrine doesn't apply.

**2. Officers acted outside their scope.** If the conduct itself was unauthorized — the department didn't sanction falsifying reports, planting evidence, or using excessive force — then the officers weren't acting within the scope of employment when they conspired. Illegal acts aren't part of anyone's job description.

**3. Mixed actors.** If your conspiracy involves anyone outside the department — officers from a different agency, private individuals, prosecutors acting outside their role — the doctrine doesn't apply because the conspirators aren't all part of the same entity.

**4. Challenge the doctrine itself.** Argue that applying it to civil rights conspiracies defeats the purpose of §§ 1983 and 1985. These statutes were specifically designed to address coordinated government misconduct. Letting a police department shield its officers from conspiracy liability by saying "they're all one entity" undermines the statutes' core function.

**5. Pursue the Monell claim instead.** If the conspiracy doctrine blocks your claim against individual officers, the coordinated conduct itself may support a [Monell claim](/primer/monell-liability) against the municipality — arguing the department had a custom or policy of tolerating this kind of coordinated misconduct.

## Do Cities Structure Departments to Exploit This?

Yes — and it's worth understanding how. Some municipalities place the police department, jail, city attorney's office, and other departments under a single organizational umbrella. Whether this is intentional or just how city government naturally works, the effect is the same: when all the actors involved in your case are employees of the same entity (the City), defendants will argue the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine bars any conspiracy claim.

Think about what this means in practice. A police officer arrests you. A jail supervisor holds you in abusive conditions. The city attorney's office makes litigation decisions that look like a cover-up. They're all "the City." Under the doctrine, they can't conspire with each other because they're all one legal person.

### How to Prove Structural Insulation

If you suspect the city's organizational structure is shielding coordinated misconduct, look for:

**Org charts and municipal codes.** Request the city's organizational chart through [FOIA/public records requests](/process/foia-and-records-requests). Review the municipal code to see how departments are legally structured. Some cities keep departments as separate legal entities (which defeats the doctrine); others consolidate everything under the city manager.

**Interagency coordination that looks like conspiracy.** If the police department and city attorney's office are coordinating to suppress evidence, coach witnesses, or delay your case — document the pattern. Emails, meeting records, and internal communications between departments can reveal coordination that goes beyond normal governmental function.

**Different chains of command.** Even within the same city, departments may have operationally independent chains of command. A police chief doesn't supervise the jail administrator, who doesn't supervise the city attorney. Argue that functional independence means they should be treated as separate actors capable of conspiracy, even if they technically share the same employer.

**Comparison across states.** If cities in other states structure these departments as independent entities, that's evidence the consolidation is a choice — not a necessity of municipal government. Don't limit your comparison to your own state. If the structure is an effective defense, most cities in the same state may have adopted it for exactly that reason. Look at how cities in plaintiff-friendly circuits organize themselves for contrast.

### What Happens If You Prove It

If you can show that the city deliberately structured its departments to create a single-entity shield:

1. **It strengthens your [Monell claim](/primer/monell-liability).** The organizational structure itself becomes evidence of a policy or custom designed to insulate misconduct from accountability. A city that structures its government to make conspiracy claims impossible has arguably created a policy of tolerating coordinated violations.

2. **Courts may pierce the corporate veil.** Some courts have held that when the organizational structure is used to facilitate or conceal constitutional violations, the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine shouldn't protect it. The doctrine exists to prevent frivolous conspiracy claims against routine business coordination — not to shield coordinated civil rights abuses.

3. **It supports a pattern-or-practice argument.** If officers, jail staff, and city attorneys repeatedly coordinate to cover up misconduct, the organizational structure is part of the pattern. Even if the conspiracy claim fails on intracorporate grounds, the evidence feeds your broader case.

4. **It's powerful at trial.** Even if the judge applies the doctrine and dismisses the conspiracy count, the evidence of cross-departmental coordination is still relevant to your other claims. Jurors can see how the system works — and that context matters.

## Practical Advice

Don't let this doctrine scare you away from alleging conspiracy when your facts support it. Plead it, and make the defendants raise the doctrine as a defense. Then fight it with the exceptions above.

Also, even if a court applies the doctrine, it only blocks the _conspiracy_ claim. Your underlying § 1983 claims against each individual officer survive. The conspiracy theory is an additional tool — losing it doesn't sink your case.
