When a court decides a legal question, that decision can become a rule that other courts have to follow. That rule is called **binding precedent** — and knowing which decisions bind your court is one of the most important things you can learn as a pro se litigant.

## How It Works

The federal court system has three levels:

1. **U.S. Supreme Court** — Its decisions bind every federal court in the country. When the Supreme Court says something, that's the law everywhere.

2. **[Circuit Courts of Appeals](/primer/federal-circuit-courts)** — The country is divided into 13 circuits, each covering multiple states. A decision by your circuit court binds every district court in that circuit. For example, the Fifth Circuit covers Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi — so a Fifth Circuit decision made in a Texas case is equally binding in Louisiana and Mississippi.

3. **District Courts** — Trial-level courts. Their decisions don't bind other district courts, even within the same circuit. They're useful as examples, but a judge in another district isn't required to follow them.

## Why This Matters for Your Case

When you cite a case in your brief, the judge cares about _where_ it came from:

- **Binding precedent** (from your circuit or the Supreme Court): The judge **must** follow it unless it's been overruled.
- **Persuasive authority** (from other circuits or district courts): The judge **can** consider it but doesn't have to follow it.

A case from your own circuit that's directly on point is worth more than a dozen cases from other circuits. When you're researching, always start with your circuit.

## Circuit Splits

Sometimes different circuits reach opposite conclusions on the same legal question. This is called a **circuit split**. Until the Supreme Court resolves it, the law can literally be different depending on which state you're in. If you find a circuit split that helps your case, point it out to the judge — it shows you've done serious research, and it might support asking for the more favorable rule.

## Common Mistake

Don't cite a case from the Ninth Circuit (California) to a judge in the Fifth Circuit (Texas) and expect it to carry the same weight as a Fifth Circuit case. It won't. The judge might find it interesting, but it's not binding. Always lead with your own circuit's cases, then use other circuits as backup.
