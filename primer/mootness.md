## What It Is

Under Article III of the Constitution, federal courts can only decide **live controversies**. If the dispute has been resolved or the plaintiff no longer has a stake in the outcome, the case is **moot** and the court must dismiss it.

## How Mootness Arises in § 1983 Cases

- **The policy changed.** You sue to stop an unconstitutional police practice and the department voluntarily abandons it.
- **You moved or left custody.** You challenge jail conditions but are released before the case is decided.
- **The harm can't recur.** The specific situation that caused your injury is over and won't happen again.

However, claims for **money damages** are almost never moot. If you are seeking [compensatory damages](/primer/compensatory-damages) for past harm, the case stays live regardless of what changes afterward.

## Exceptions to Mootness

Courts recognize several important exceptions:

### Voluntary Cessation

A defendant can't moot a case just by stopping the challenged conduct. The court will keep the case alive unless it is **absolutely clear** the behavior won't resume. [Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services, 528 U.S. 167 (2000)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118384/friends-of-earth-inc-v-laidlaw-environmental-services-toe-inc/).

### Capable of Repetition, Yet Evading Review

If the challenged action is too short in duration to be fully litigated before it ends, and there is a reasonable expectation it will happen again, the case survives. [Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108713/roe-v-wade/) applied this doctrine.

### Class Actions

In certified class actions, the named plaintiff's individual claim becoming moot does not necessarily moot the class claims.

## Practical Tips

- **Always include a damages claim** alongside any request for [injunctive relief](/primer/injunctive-relief) or a [declaratory judgment](/primer/declaratory-judgment). Damages keep the case alive even if circumstances change.
- **If the government changes its policy**, argue the voluntary cessation exception — they might change it back.
- **Document ongoing harm.** If you can show the violation is likely to recur, the case is not moot.
- **File promptly.** Delays increase the risk that changed circumstances will moot your claims.

## Key Takeaway

A case is moot when there is nothing left for the court to decide. Protect yourself by seeking money damages and acting quickly.
