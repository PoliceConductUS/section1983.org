## What It Is

When police make a lawful arrest, the [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment) allows them to search the arrested person and the area within their immediate reach — without a [warrant](/primer/warrant-requirement). This is called a "search incident to arrest" (sometimes abbreviated SITA).

The justification is twofold: officer safety (removing weapons) and preventing destruction of evidence.

## The Basic Rule

Under [Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752 (1969)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108086/chimel-v-california/), officers may search:

1. **The arrestee's person** — pockets, clothing, anything they're carrying
2. **The area within the arrestee's immediate control** — the "grab area" where they could reach a weapon or destroy evidence

They may **not** use the arrest as an excuse to search the entire house, car trunk, or other areas beyond the person's reach.

## Cell Phones Are Different

In [Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373 (2014)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2713657/riley-v-california/), the Supreme Court unanimously held that officers **cannot** search a cell phone incident to arrest without a warrant. The Court recognized that modern smartphones contain vast amounts of private information — far beyond what a physical search of pockets would reveal. If police searched your phone without a warrant after arresting you, that search likely violated the Fourth Amendment.

## Vehicle Searches After Arrest

The rules for cars narrowed significantly in [Arizona v. Gant, 556 U.S. 332 (2009)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/145867/arizona-v-gant/). Officers may search a vehicle incident to arrest **only** if:

- The arrestee is **unsecured and within reaching distance** of the passenger compartment, OR
- It is **reasonable to believe** the vehicle contains evidence of the crime of arrest

If you were already handcuffed and locked in the patrol car, officers generally cannot search your vehicle under this exception.

## Why It Matters in § 1983 Cases

If the underlying arrest was unlawful ([false arrest](/primer/false-arrest)), any search incident to that arrest is also unlawful. Additionally, even after a valid arrest, officers who exceed the allowed scope — searching areas out of reach, going through your phone, or rifling through your car after you're secured — may have violated your Fourth Amendment rights.

Common issues include:

- **No lawful arrest** — If there was no [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause) for the arrest, the search falls too
- **Exceeded scope** — Searched rooms, vehicles, or containers beyond your immediate reach
- **Cell phone search without warrant** — Almost always unconstitutional after _Riley_
