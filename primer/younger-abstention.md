Younger abstention is one of the most common ways pro se § 1983 cases get dismissed early. The rule is simple: **if you have a pending state court criminal case, the federal court will refuse to interfere with it.** Your § 1983 case will be dismissed or stayed until the state case is finished.

This comes from _Younger v. Harris_, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), where the Supreme Court held that federal courts should not enjoin ongoing state criminal proceedings except in extraordinary circumstances.

## Why This Matters for You

Here's the scenario that catches people: You get arrested. You believe the arrest violated your rights. You're charged with a crime (resisting arrest, assault on an officer, disorderly conduct — the usual retaliatory charges). While the criminal case is pending, you file a § 1983 lawsuit.

The federal court will almost certainly dismiss or stay your § 1983 case. Not because your claims are bad — but because the criminal case is still going.

## When Younger Abstention Applies

A federal court will abstain when three conditions are met:

1. **There's an ongoing state proceeding** — Your criminal case is still pending (not yet resolved by trial, plea, or dismissal).

2. **The state proceeding involves important state interests** — Criminal prosecutions almost always qualify. So do some civil enforcement proceedings and certain administrative proceedings.

3. **You have an adequate opportunity to raise your federal claims in the state proceeding** — You can raise constitutional defenses (like an illegal arrest or coerced confession) in the criminal case itself.

## The Timing Trap

The critical question is: **was the state case pending when you filed the federal case?**

- If the criminal case is **still pending** when you file → Younger applies, federal case dismissed/stayed.
- If the criminal case is **already resolved** when you file → Younger doesn't apply (but watch out for the [Heck doctrine](/primer/heck-doctrine) if you were convicted).
- If the criminal case is **filed after** you file your § 1983 case → Younger generally doesn't apply, though some courts disagree.

## What to Do

### Wait for the criminal case to finish

This is the safest approach. Once the criminal case is resolved — whether by acquittal, dismissal, or even conviction — Younger no longer blocks your § 1983 case.

### Watch the statute of limitations

The danger of waiting is that the [statute of limitations](/primer/statute-of-limitations) keeps running. In most states, § 1983 claims have a two- or three-year limitations period (borrowed from the state's personal injury statute). If your criminal case drags on for years, your § 1983 claims could expire.

Some states [toll](/primer/tolling) the limitations period while criminal charges are pending. Others don't. Research your state's rule — this is critical.

### File and accept a stay

If the statute of limitations is about to expire, you can file the § 1983 case to preserve your claims and accept that the court will likely stay (pause) it until the criminal case resolves. This protects your claims without running afoul of Younger. Make sure to tell the court you understand Younger may apply and request a stay rather than dismissal.

### The narrow exceptions

Younger has exceptions, but they're rarely successful:

- **Bad faith prosecution** — If you can show the criminal charges were filed in bad faith specifically to harass you or retaliate for exercising your rights. This is extremely hard to prove at the federal level.
- **Patently unconstitutional statute** — If the criminal law itself is facially unconstitutional. Rare.
- **No adequate state remedy** — If the state court system genuinely cannot address your federal claims. Courts almost never find this.

## Connection to Heck

Younger and the [Heck doctrine](/primer/heck-doctrine) are related but different:

- **Younger** says: "Don't file while the criminal case is pending."
- **Heck** says: "If you were convicted, you can't use § 1983 to challenge the conviction unless it's been overturned."

Together they create a one-two punch: Younger blocks you while the case is active, and Heck can block you after a conviction. The path through is acquittal or dismissal of the criminal charges — which is why fighting the criminal case matters for your civil rights claims too.

## Practical Advice

**Don't file your § 1983 case while criminal charges are pending unless you're about to lose your statute of limitations.** It wastes filing fees, and a dismissal — even one based on Younger — can be demoralizing and confusing.

Instead, use the time while the criminal case is pending to **prepare**. Gather evidence, file [FOIA requests](/process/foia-and-records-requests), research the officers' history, study your [circuit's case law](/primer/federal-circuit-courts), and build your [war room](/process/organizing-your-war-room). When the criminal case resolves, you'll be ready to file a strong § 1983 complaint immediately.
