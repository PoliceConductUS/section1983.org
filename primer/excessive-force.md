## What It Is

An excessive force claim alleges that a law enforcement officer used more force than was reasonably necessary under the circumstances. For people who haven't been convicted (most § 1983 plaintiffs), the claim arises under the **Fourth Amendment** and is analyzed under the "objective reasonableness" standard from [Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/).

This is the most plaintiff-friendly [mental state standard](/primer/state-of-mind) in § 1983 — you don't need to prove the officer intended to hurt you or acted with malice.

## The Graham Factors

Courts evaluate force by considering the "totality of the circumstances," with three primary factors:

1. **Severity of the crime at issue** — Was the suspect accused of a violent felony or a minor traffic violation?
2. **Whether the suspect poses an immediate threat** to the safety of officers or others
3. **Whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade**

These aren't a checklist — they're a framework. Courts weigh them together and from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, not in hindsight.

## What "Objective Reasonableness" Means

The question is: Would a **reasonable officer** in the same situation, with the same information, have used the same level of force?

Key principle: "The calculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments — in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving." Graham, 490 U.S. at 396-97.

Courts give significant deference to officers. This is the hurdle you face.

## Types of Force Claims

- **Deadly force**: Shooting, chokehold, vehicle ramming. Governed by [Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111423/tennessee-v-garner/) — deadly force is only justified when the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious injury
- **Less-lethal force**: Tasers, pepper spray, takedowns, tight handcuffing
- **Force during arrest**: Slamming against vehicles, knee-on-neck, punching
- **Force against compliant suspects**: This is where many winning claims arise — force used after the suspect is already subdued or cooperating

## The Practical Reality

Excessive force cases are **fact-intensive**. Video evidence (body cameras, dashcams, bystander recordings) can make or break your claim. If video exists, courts are required to view the facts "in the light depicted by the videotape." [Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372 (2007)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/145721/scott-v-harris/).

Without video, it's your word against theirs — and juries tend to believe officers.
