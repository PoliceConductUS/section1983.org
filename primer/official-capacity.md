## What It Is

An official capacity suit treats the named officer as a stand-in for the government entity they represent. You're not really suing Officer Smith — you're suing the police department through Officer Smith.

[Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159 (1985)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111546/kentucky-v-graham/): "Official capacity suits generally represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent."

## When to Use It

- **Injunctive relief**: You want the government to _stop doing something_ or _start doing something_. An official capacity suit against a state official can get you an injunction under [Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/96770/ex-parte-young/).
- **Municipal defendants**: An official capacity suit against a city official is the same as suing the city. If you're already suing the city directly (under [Monell](/primer/monell-liability)), the official capacity claim is redundant.

## When Not to Use It

- **Money damages against state officials**: The [Eleventh Amendment](/primer/eleventh-amendment) blocks it. An official capacity suit against a state trooper for damages is a suit against the state — barred.
- **When you've already named the municipality**: If you're suing the City of Springfield _and_ Officer Smith in his official capacity, the official capacity claim is duplicative. Courts often dismiss it as redundant.

## The Practical Move

In most § 1983 cases against local police:

1. Sue the **officers in their [individual capacity](/primer/individual-capacity)** → money damages
2. Sue the **municipality directly** under Monell → money damages
3. Sue a **supervisory official in official capacity** → injunctive relief (policy changes, training reforms)

This covers all your bases without redundancy.

## Key Cases

- [Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159 (1985)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111546/kentucky-v-graham/) — Official capacity = suit against the entity
- [Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/96770/ex-parte-young/) — Injunctive relief against state officials despite Eleventh Amendment
- [Brandon v. Holt, 469 U.S. 464 (1985)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111354/brandon-v-holt/) — Judgment against officer in official capacity is enforceable against the entity
