## What They Are

The Graham factors come from [Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/) and provide the framework for evaluating [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force) claims under the Fourth Amendment:

1. **The severity of the crime at issue**
2. **Whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of officers or others**
3. **Whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight**

## How Courts Apply Them

These aren't a mechanical checklist — they're guideposts for the "totality of the circumstances" analysis. The court asks: Given these factors, would a **reasonable officer** on the scene have used this level of force?

**Factor 1 — Severity of the crime**: Force that might be reasonable when arresting someone for armed robbery is unreasonable during a traffic stop. The more serious the crime, the more force courts will tolerate.

**Factor 2 — Immediate threat**: This is the most important factor. If the suspect poses no immediate threat — hands raised, unarmed, compliant — force is much harder to justify. Conversely, a suspect reaching for a weapon creates an imminent threat that justifies significant force.

**Factor 3 — Resistance or flight**: A suspect who is running gets more force than one standing still. A suspect who is struggling gets more force than one who is compliant. But once resistance ends, so should the force.

## The Catch

Courts evaluate force "from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight." Graham, 490 U.S. at 396. This deference makes it hard to second-guess officers.

But deference has limits. In [Tolan v. Cotton, 572 U.S. 650 (2014)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2649261/tolan-v-cotton/), the Supreme Court reversed a grant of summary judgment because the lower court failed to view the facts in the plaintiff's favor — crediting the officer's account over the plaintiff's.
