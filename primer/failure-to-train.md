## What It Is

Failure to train is one way to hold a **city or municipality** liable under § 1983 through [Monell liability](/primer/monell-liability). The idea is simple: if a city fails to properly train its police officers, and that failure leads to constitutional violations, the city itself can be held responsible.

The landmark case is [City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378 (1989)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112212/city-of-canton-v-harris/).

## What You Must Prove

Failure-to-train claims have a high bar. You must show:

1. **A training program is inadequate** — The city's training was deficient in a specific area related to the constitutional violation you suffered.

2. **[Deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference)** — The city knew (or obviously should have known) that the lack of training would lead to constitutional violations. Simple negligence is not enough.

3. **[Moving force causation](/primer/moving-force-causation)** — The training failure was the "moving force" behind your specific constitutional injury. You must connect the training gap directly to what happened to you.

## How to Show Deliberate Indifference

There are two main ways:

### Pattern of Violations

The most common approach: show that officers have **repeatedly violated rights in the same way**, putting the city on notice that training was inadequate. For example, multiple complaints about officers using chokeholds might show the city knew its use-of-force training was deficient.

### Single-Incident Liability

In rare cases, a **single incident** can establish deliberate indifference if the need for training was so obvious. [City of Canton](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112212/city-of-canton-v-harris/) used the example of arming officers with guns but providing no training on when to use deadly force — the risk of constitutional violations is so predictable that failing to train is deliberately indifferent.

The Supreme Court reinforced the high standard in [Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51 (2011)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/210667/connick-v-thompson/), making single-incident claims very difficult to win.

## Practical Tips

- **Request training records** during [discovery](/primer/discovery). Ask for the city's use-of-force training curriculum, the hours of training provided, and any records of past complaints.
- **Look for a pattern.** Gather evidence of prior similar incidents — internal affairs complaints, prior lawsuits, news reports.
- **Be specific.** Identify the exact training deficiency — don't just say "the city failed to train." Specify what training was missing (e.g., de-escalation techniques, proper handcuffing, medical attention for detainees).
- **Connect it to your injury.** Show how better training would have prevented what happened to you.

## Key Takeaway

A city can be liable when its failure to train officers shows deliberate indifference to constitutional rights — but you must prove a specific training gap, notice, and a direct connection to your harm.
