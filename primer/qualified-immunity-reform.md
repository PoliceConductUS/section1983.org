## What It Is

Qualified immunity reform is the movement to modify or eliminate the judicially created doctrine that shields government officials from liability. It spans the political spectrum — from progressive civil rights organizations to libertarian think tanks.

## Why It's Bipartisan

**From the left**: QI disproportionately harms communities of color and low-income communities by making it impossible to hold officers accountable for violence.

**From the right**: QI is judge-made law with no basis in the text of § 1983. Conservatives who believe in textualism, originalism, and individual rights have reason to oppose a doctrine the Supreme Court invented out of whole cloth.

**From libertarians**: QI represents government overreach — the state harming individuals and then invoking its own doctrine to escape accountability.

## Legislative Efforts

### Federal

- **George Floyd Justice in Policing Act** — Would have eliminated QI for law enforcement. Passed the House in 2021, failed in the Senate.
- **Reforming Qualified Immunity Act** — Bipartisan bill to eliminate QI. Introduced multiple times, never passed.

### State

Several states have passed their own reforms:

- **Colorado** (2020) — Eliminated QI in state court for state claims
- **New Mexico** (2021) — Created a state civil rights act without QI defense
- **New York City** — Local legislation allowing suits without QI defense
- **Connecticut** (2020) — Limited QI defense for police officers

## Judicial Voices

- **Justice Clarence Thomas** — Questioned QI's historical basis in [Ziglar v. Abbasi](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/8429442/ziglar-v-abbasi/) concurrence
- **Justice Sonia Sotomayor** — Repeatedly dissented from QI grants, calling it a license to "shoot first and think later"
- **Multiple circuit judges** — Have called on the Supreme Court or Congress to reconsider QI while conceding they're bound by precedent
