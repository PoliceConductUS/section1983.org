## What It Is

Venue is about **where** you file your case. Even if a federal court has jurisdiction over your § 1983 claim, you can't just file in any federal court in the country. The venue statute — 28 U.S.C. § 1391 — tells you which federal district court is the proper place.

## The Basic Rule

Under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b), you can file your § 1983 case in a district where:

1. **Any defendant resides**, if all defendants reside in the same state
2. **A substantial part of the events** giving rise to the claim occurred
3. **Any defendant is subject to personal jurisdiction**, but only if no other district qualifies

For most § 1983 cases, the easiest option is **#2** — file in the district where the constitutional violation happened. If a police officer used excessive force against you in Phoenix, Arizona, you would file in the District of Arizona.

## Where Does a Defendant "Reside"?

- **Individual defendants** (like police officers) reside where they are domiciled — their permanent home.
- **Municipal defendants** (like a city or county) reside in any district where they are subject to personal jurisdiction. For a city, that is typically the district where the city is located.

## Transfer of Venue

Even if you pick a proper venue, a defendant can ask to **transfer** the case to a more convenient district under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a). The court considers factors like where the witnesses and evidence are, and the convenience of the parties. See [In re Volkswagen of America, Inc., 545 F.3d 304 (5th Cir. 2008)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1268889/in-re-volkswagen-of-america-inc/).

If you file in the **wrong** venue entirely, the court can either dismiss or transfer the case under 28 U.S.C. § 1406(a).

## Practical Tips

- **File where it happened.** The district where the police misconduct occurred is almost always proper venue and the most convenient for you.
- **Check the district.** The federal court system divides each state into one or more districts. Look up which district covers the location of the incident at [uscourts.gov](https://www.uscourts.gov/federal-court-finder/search).
- **Don't confuse venue with [jurisdiction](/primer/federal-jurisdiction).** Jurisdiction is whether the court has _power_ to hear your type of case. Venue is whether the case is filed in the right _place_.
- **Venue objections can be waived.** If the defendant doesn't object to improper venue early in the case, they lose the right to challenge it later.

## Key Takeaway

For most § 1983 cases, file in the federal district where the unconstitutional conduct occurred. That is usually the simplest and safest choice.
