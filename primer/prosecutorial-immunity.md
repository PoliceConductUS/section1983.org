## What It Is

Prosecutorial immunity is a form of [absolute immunity](/primer/absolute-immunity) that protects prosecutors from § 1983 liability for actions taken as **advocates** — deciding to prosecute, presenting evidence at trial, arguing before a grand jury, and conducting trials.

[Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409 (1976)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109398/imbler-v-pachtman/) established the doctrine. A prosecutor who **knowingly** uses fabricated testimony to convict an innocent person is absolutely immune from your civil suit. Yes, really.

## The Function Test

Immunity depends on the **function** performed, not the person's title:

**Absolutely immune (advocacy function):**

- Deciding whether to prosecute
- Presenting evidence to a grand jury or at trial
- Making arguments in court
- Plea negotiations

**Only qualified immunity (investigative function):**

- Giving legal advice to police during an investigation
- Participating in searches or interrogations
- Fabricating evidence _before_ it enters the judicial process
- Making public statements to the press

The line is crossed when the prosecutor acts more like a police officer than a lawyer. [Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S. 259 (1993)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112885/buckley-v-fitzsimmons/).

## Why It's Outrageous

The doctrine means:

- A prosecutor who hides exculpatory evidence (Brady violation) is absolutely immune if they did it as part of trial preparation
- A prosecutor who presents testimony they know is false is absolutely immune
- A prosecutor who selectively prosecutes based on race is absolutely immune for the charging decision

Your only recourse: bar complaints, judicial referral for sanctions, or hoping the DOJ prosecutes under 18 U.S.C. § 242 (it almost never does).

## The Connick Aftermath

[Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51 (2011)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/209802/connick-v-thompson/) closed another door. Thompson spent 18 years in prison (14 on death row) because prosecutors hid blood evidence. He won a $14 million verdict against the DA's office under [Monell](/primer/monell-liability) — failure to train. The Supreme Court reversed 5-4, holding a single Brady violation can't establish failure to train.

So: the individual prosecutor is absolutely immune. The office can only be liable under Monell if there's a _pattern_ of violations — but since individual violations are immune from suit, it's nearly impossible to build the pattern.

## Key Cases

- [Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409 (1976)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109398/imbler-v-pachtman/) — Absolute immunity for advocacy functions
- [Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S. 259 (1993)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112885/buckley-v-fitzsimmons/) — Only qualified immunity for investigative functions
- [Kalina v. Fletcher, 522 U.S. 118 (1997)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118229/kalina-v-fletcher/) — No absolute immunity for making false statements in an affidavit (witness function, not advocacy)
- [Van de Kamp v. Goldstein, 555 U.S. 335 (2009)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/145903/van-de-kamp-v-goldstein/) — Absolute immunity for supervisory prosecutors' failure to train on Brady obligations
