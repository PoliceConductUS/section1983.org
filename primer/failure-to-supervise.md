## What It Is

A failure-to-supervise claim alleges that a supervisor or municipality failed to adequately monitor and control subordinate officers, and that this failure led directly to a constitutional violation. It is closely related to [failure to train](/primer/failure-to-train) and [supervisory liability](/primer/supervisory-liability), but focuses specifically on the **ongoing oversight** of officers' conduct.

The idea: if a police department knows (or should know) that an officer is a ticking time bomb — racking up complaints, using excessive force, violating rights — and does nothing, the department's inaction can itself be a constitutional violation.

## The Legal Standard

Failure-to-supervise claims require showing [deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference) — a very high bar. You must prove:

1. **The supervisor or municipality knew of a pattern** of similar constitutional violations by subordinates
2. **The response was clearly inadequate** — they failed to investigate complaints, discipline officers, or take corrective action
3. **The failure was "closely related" to the violation** — the inadequate supervision actually caused or enabled the specific harm you suffered
4. **The need for better supervision was obvious** — a reasonable policymaker would have recognized that the lack of supervision would lead to violations

Simple negligence — "they should have been paying closer attention" — is not enough. You need to show the supervisory failure was so egregious that it amounted to a **deliberate choice** to allow violations to continue.

## Individual vs. Municipal Claims

Failure to supervise can support two types of claims:

- **Against individual supervisors** — A sergeant, lieutenant, or chief who personally knew about an officer's pattern of misconduct and did nothing. This ties into [personal participation](/primer/personal-participation) and [supervisory liability](/primer/supervisory-liability).
- **Against the municipality** — Under [Monell](/primer/monell-liability), a city can be liable if its policy or custom of inadequate supervision caused the violation. This is sometimes easier because you're attacking a systemic failure, not just one person's knowledge.

## Evidence That Helps

- **Prior complaints** against the officer — especially if they were ignored or dismissed without investigation
- **Prior lawsuits** involving the same officer or similar misconduct in the department
- **Internal affairs records** showing a pattern of sustained complaints with no discipline
- **Lack of any supervision system** — no regular reviews, no use-of-force tracking, no early warning systems
- **Supervisor knowledge** — emails, reports, or testimony showing supervisors were aware of problems

## Common Scenarios

- An officer with **dozens of excessive force complaints** keeps working the street with no intervention
- A department has **no system for tracking officer complaints** or use-of-force incidents
- A supervisor **witnesses misconduct** and takes no corrective action
- Officers with **known substance abuse or behavioral issues** receive no monitoring

## Key Cases

- [City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378 (1989)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112217/city-of-canton-v-harris/) — Established the deliberate indifference standard for failure-to-train/supervise claims
- [Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51 (2011)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/217011/connick-v-thompson/) — Pattern of violations generally required; single incident usually insufficient
- [Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/145875/ashcroft-v-iqbal/) — Supervisors need personal involvement; no vicarious liability in § 1983
