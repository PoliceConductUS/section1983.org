## What It Is

Ratification is one path to [municipal liability](/primer/municipal-liability) under [Monell](/primer/monell-liability). It applies when a city's [final policymaker](/primer/final-policymaker) reviews an employee's unconstitutional conduct and **approves it** — either explicitly or by choosing not to act when action was clearly required.

The key case is [City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112 (1988)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112093/city-of-st-louis-v-praprotnik/).

## How It Works

To prove ratification, you must show:

1. **An employee committed a constitutional violation** — for example, an officer used excessive force.
2. **A final policymaker learned about the specific conduct** — the policymaker must have known what actually happened, not just a sanitized version.
3. **The policymaker approved or endorsed the conduct** — through an explicit decision, a failure to discipline, or a public statement defending the action.

## What Counts as Ratification?

- A police chief reviews body camera footage of an officer beating a handcuffed suspect and **declares the force was appropriate** ✅
- The city council reviews a complaint about an unconstitutional arrest policy and **votes to keep the policy** ✅
- A supervisor conducts a perfunctory investigation and **clears the officer without meaningfully reviewing the evidence** — courts are split, but some find this sufficient ⚠️

## What Does NOT Count

- A low-level supervisor approving the conduct — the person must be a **final policymaker** as defined by state or local law
- Mere failure to discipline without actual knowledge of the constitutional violation
- A policymaker disagreeing with the conduct but lacking authority to change it

## Key Cases

- [City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112 (1988)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112093/city-of-st-louis-v-praprotnik/) — Ratification by a final policymaker can establish Monell liability.
- [Gillette v. Delmore, 979 F.2d 1342 (9th Cir. 1992)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/593099/gillette-v-delmore/) — A policymaker's approval of unconstitutional conduct after a meaningful review can constitute ratification.

## Practical Tips

- **Identify the final policymaker.** This is determined by state or local law — it might be the police chief, city manager, or city council depending on the jurisdiction. See [final policymaker](/primer/final-policymaker).
- **Get the investigation file.** Request internal affairs records during [discovery](/primer/discovery) to show what the policymaker knew and decided.
- **Look for public statements.** Did the chief or mayor publicly defend the officer's actions? That can be powerful evidence of ratification.
- **Ratification is claim-specific.** The policymaker must have ratified the specific constitutional violation, not just general job performance.

## Key Takeaway

When a final policymaker approves an officer's unconstitutional conduct after learning what happened, the city itself becomes liable. Focus on showing what the policymaker knew and what they decided.
