## What It Is

The Fourteenth Amendment does two things that matter for § 1983:

1. **Due Process Clause**: "No State shall... deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"
2. **Equal Protection Clause**: "nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws"

It also **incorporates** most of the Bill of Rights against state governments. Without the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment wouldn't apply to local police at all.

## Due Process: Procedural vs. Substantive

**Procedural due process** means the government must give you notice and an opportunity to be heard before depriving you of life, liberty, or property. Did you get a hearing? Were you told the charges? Could you respond?

**[Substantive due process](/primer/substantive-due-process)** means some government conduct is so outrageous that no amount of process can justify it. It protects fundamental rights — bodily integrity, freedom from arbitrary government action — regardless of the procedures used.

In § 1983 cases, substantive due process claims arise when:

- Pretrial detainees face unconstitutional conditions (this is Fourteenth Amendment, not Eighth, because they haven't been convicted)
- Officials engage in conduct that "shocks the conscience"
- Government action is arbitrary and irrational

The [mental state standard](/primer/state-of-mind) under the Fourteenth Amendment varies by claim. Excessive force against pretrial detainees uses **objective reasonableness** (after _Kingsley v. Hendrickson_, 576 U.S. 389 (2015)). Conditions of confinement and medical care claims require **[deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference)**. Substantive due process claims require conduct that **shocks the conscience** — the highest bar in § 1983. Equal protection claims require proof of **intentional discrimination**.

## Equal Protection

Equal protection claims in § 1983 allege that the government treated you differently from similarly situated people without a rational basis — or, if a protected class is involved (race, religion, national origin), without a compelling interest.

**Selective enforcement**: Police arrested you for something they routinely ignore when others do it. If the selective enforcement is based on race or another protected characteristic, it's an equal protection violation.

**Class-of-one**: Even without a protected class, you can claim equal protection if you were intentionally treated differently from others similarly situated, with no rational basis.

## The "More Specific Provision" Rule

Important: if a more specific constitutional provision covers your claim, use that instead of the Fourteenth Amendment. [Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/) held that excessive force during arrest is a Fourth Amendment claim, not Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process.

Use the Fourteenth Amendment when:

- You're a pretrial detainee (not yet convicted)
- The conduct doesn't fit neatly under a more specific amendment
- You're alleging equal protection, not just a liberty deprivation
