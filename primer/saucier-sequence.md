## What It Is

The Saucier sequence was the mandatory two-step analysis for [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) established in [Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194 (2001)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118445/saucier-v-katz/):

**Step 1**: Did the officer violate a constitutional right?
**Step 2**: Was that right clearly established at the time?

Courts had to answer Step 1 first. The purpose: by deciding the constitutional question, courts would build precedent that future plaintiffs could cite to show a right was "clearly established."

## Why It Mattered

The Saucier sequence was designed to prevent the qualified immunity ratchet. If courts must decide whether a right exists before asking if it was clearly established, new rights get established over time. Future plaintiffs benefit from today's rulings.

## What Happened

[Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223 (2009)](/primer/pearson-v-callahan) overruled Saucier's mandatory sequence. Courts now have discretion to address either prong first — and can skip the constitutional question entirely by going straight to "not clearly established."

The result: fewer constitutional questions decided, fewer rights clearly established, and a widening gap between the conduct that violates the Constitution and the conduct that actually leads to liability.

## Why You Should Know This

Even though the Saucier sequence is no longer mandatory, you can **argue that the court should follow it**. Some judges still do. If your case involves an important constitutional question that needs to be resolved — especially if it would establish the right for future cases — make the argument that the court should address the merits, not just duck behind "not clearly established."

## Key Cases

- [Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194 (2001)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118445/saucier-v-katz/) — Mandatory two-step sequence
- [Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223 (2009)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/145906/pearson-v-callahan/) — Made it optional
