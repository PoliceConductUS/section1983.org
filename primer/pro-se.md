## What It Is

Pro se (Latin: "for oneself") means representing yourself in a legal proceeding without an attorney. In § 1983 cases, the vast majority of plaintiffs are pro se — either because they can't find an attorney willing to take the case or can't afford one.

## Liberal Construction

Courts are required to construe pro se filings "liberally" — reading them with more leniency than filings by attorneys. [Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519 (1972)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108464/haines-v-kerner/).

This means:

- Your complaint doesn't need perfect legal terminology
- Courts should look past formatting and procedural errors to the substance of your claims
- A pro se complaint shouldn't be dismissed unless it's clear the claims are legally insufficient

## What Liberal Construction Doesn't Mean

- It doesn't excuse you from following rules of procedure
- It doesn't lower the [plausibility pleading](/primer/plausibility-pleading) standard
- It doesn't mean the court will make arguments for you
- It doesn't exempt you from discovery obligations or deadlines
- It doesn't prevent sanctions for frivolous filings

The reality: courts say "liberal construction" but still hold pro se litigants to the same substantive standards as attorneys. You get some slack on form, almost none on substance.

## What Courts Actually Expect

- **Follow the rules** — Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, local rules, and the judge's individual practices. Read them.
- **Meet deadlines** — No extensions just because you're pro se
- **Be professional** — Emotional outbursts, personal attacks on opposing counsel, or conspiracy theories in your filings will hurt your credibility
- **Organize your filings** — Numbered paragraphs, clear headings, page numbers, proper caption
- **Serve opposing counsel** — Everything you file with the court must also be sent to the other side

## The Hard Truth

Pro se litigants lose the vast majority of § 1983 cases. Not because their claims lack merit, but because:

- [Qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) is designed to end cases early
- [Iqbal/Twombly](/primer/plausibility-pleading) demands sophisticated pleading
- Discovery requires knowing what to ask for and how
- Summary judgment briefing is essentially lawyer work

This site exists to help close that gap. But go in with clear eyes: you are fighting an uphill battle, and the system was not designed for you to succeed.

## Key Cases

- [Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519 (1972)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108464/haines-v-kerner/) — Liberal construction of pro se filings
- [Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89 (2007)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/145752/erickson-v-pardus/) — Pro se complaints held to less stringent standards
