## What It Is

A consent search happens when police ask to search you or your property and **you agree**. Valid consent eliminates the need for a [warrant](/primer/warrant-requirement) or [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause). But consent must be **voluntary** — not the product of coercion, threats, or deception.

The foundational case is [Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218 (1973)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108798/schneckloth-v-bustamonte/).

## What Makes Consent Voluntary?

Courts look at the **totality of the circumstances** to decide if consent was freely given. Factors include:

- **Was the person in custody** or free to leave?
- **Did officers use threats, force, or intimidation?**
- **How many officers were present?** A single officer asking politely is different from five officers surrounding you.
- **Did the person know they could refuse?** Officers are **not required** to tell you that you have the right to say no. [Schneckloth v. Bustamonte](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108798/schneckloth-v-bustamonte/). But whether you knew is one factor the court considers.
- **Was the person's will overborne** by the circumstances?

## Who Can Consent?

- **You** can consent to a search of your own property.
- **A third party** with common authority over the property can consent. [Illinois v. Rodriguez, 497 U.S. 177 (1990)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112474/illinois-v-rodriguez/). A roommate can consent to a search of shared spaces.
- **But one co-occupant can object.** If you are physically present and refuse consent, police cannot rely on your co-occupant's consent. [Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U.S. 103 (2006)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/145583/georgia-v-randolph/). However, [Fernandez v. California, 571 U.S. 292 (2014)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2672962/fernandez-v-california/) held that if the objecting occupant is removed (e.g., lawfully arrested), the remaining occupant can then consent.

## Scope of Consent

You can **limit** your consent. If you say "you can look in the living room," officers cannot search your bedroom. You can also **withdraw** consent at any time. [Florida v. Jimeno, 500 U.S. 248 (1991)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112600/florida-v-jimeno/) held that the scope of consent is measured by what a reasonable person would have understood.

## Practical Tips

- **You can say no.** Politely but firmly state: "I do not consent to a search." This is your constitutional right.
- **Be clear and unambiguous.** Silence or passively stepping aside may be interpreted as consent.
- **You can limit consent.** "You can look in the trunk, but not the glove box" is valid.
- **You can withdraw consent at any time.** Say "I'm withdrawing my consent" clearly.
- **If you were coerced**, your consent was not voluntary. Document any threats, intimidation, drawn weapons, or claims like "we'll get a warrant anyway."
- **Don't physically resist.** If officers search despite your refusal, do not physically obstruct them. State your objection verbally and challenge the search later in court.

## Key Takeaway

You have the right to refuse a search. If you do consent, make sure it's truly voluntary, and know that you can limit or withdraw that consent at any time.
