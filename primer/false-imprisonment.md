## What It Is

False imprisonment is the unlawful restraint of a person's freedom of movement. In the § 1983 context, it typically means the government detained you — in a jail, a holding cell, a police car, or even on the street — without legal justification.

False imprisonment and [false arrest](/primer/false-arrest) are closely related and often brought together. The key difference: false arrest focuses on the **initial seizure** (the moment you're taken into custody), while false imprisonment covers the **ongoing detention** that follows.

## The Elements

To prove false imprisonment under the [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment), you generally need to show:

1. You were **confined or restrained** against your will
2. The defendant **caused** the confinement
3. There was **no legal authority** for the detention
4. You suffered **harm** as a result (even brief detention counts)

## How It Works With § 1983

The Supreme Court in [Manuel v. City of Joliet, 580 U.S. 357 (2017)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/8403081/manuel-v-city-of-joliet-illinois/) confirmed that [pretrial detention](/primer/pretrial-detention) without [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause) is a Fourth Amendment violation — not just a due process claim. This means if you were held in jail after an arrest that lacked probable cause, the Fourth Amendment covers the entire period of detention.

## When the Claim Starts and Ends

Under [Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384 (2007)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/145700/wallace-v-kato/), the [statute of limitations](/primer/statute-of-limitations) for false imprisonment begins to run when the imprisonment **ends** — meaning when you are:

- **Released** from custody
- **Arraigned** before a judge
- **Bound over** by a magistrate

Once a judge makes an independent probable cause determination (like at arraignment), the false imprisonment claim based on the initial arrest typically ends. Any continued detention after that point may require a different legal theory, such as [malicious prosecution](/primer/malicious-prosecution).

## Common Scenarios

- **Held in jail after charges are dropped** — If the system keeps you locked up after there's no legal basis, that's false imprisonment
- **Detained for an unreasonably long time before arraignment** — You have a right to a prompt judicial determination of probable cause, typically within 48 hours ([County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44 (1991)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112635/county-of-riverside-v-mclaughlin/))
- **Immigration detainer holds** — Held past your release date on an ICE detainer without a judicial warrant
- **Locked in a police car during an unjustified stop** — Even brief confinement can qualify

- [County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44 (1991)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112635/county-of-riverside-v-mclaughlin/) — 48-hour rule for judicial probable cause determination
