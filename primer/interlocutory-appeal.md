## What It Is

An interlocutory appeal is an appeal taken **before** the trial court enters a final judgment. Normally, you can't appeal until the case is completely over (the "final judgment rule" under 28 U.S.C. § 1291). Interlocutory appeals are the exception.

## The Collateral Order Doctrine

Under the [collateral order doctrine](/primer/collateral-order-doctrine) from [Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/104715/cohen-v-beneficial-industrial-loan-corp/), an order is immediately appealable if it:

1. Conclusively determines the disputed question
2. Resolves an important issue completely separate from the merits
3. Is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment

## Why It Matters for § 1983

The most common interlocutory appeal in § 1983 cases: **denial of qualified immunity**. When a court denies QI at summary judgment, the defendant can immediately appeal that denial to the circuit court. [Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511 (1985)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111530/mitchell-v-forsyth/).

This means the case **stops** while the appeal is pending. Discovery halts. Trial dates get pushed. Your case can sit on ice for a year or more while the circuit court decides whether QI should have been granted.

For defendants, this is a feature, not a bug. Even if they lose the interlocutory appeal, they've bought themselves a year of delay.

## The Johnson Stay

Under [Apostol v. Gallion, 870 F.2d 1335 (7th Cir. 1989)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/527126/richard-p-apostol-cross-appellee-v-city-of-seattle-cross-appellant/) and its progeny, trial courts generally **must stay all proceedings** during a QI interlocutory appeal — not just as to the appealing defendant, but sometimes as to all defendants if the issues overlap.

## For Pro Se Plaintiffs

You can also take an interlocutory appeal in narrow circumstances — for example, if the court grants a defendant's motion to dismiss on qualified immunity. But be careful:

- **Strict time limits**: You typically have 30 days to file a notice of appeal
- **The appeal must present a legal question**: You can't use an interlocutory appeal to challenge factual findings
- **It's expensive and slow**: Appellate briefing takes months

## Key Cases

- [Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511 (1985)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111530/mitchell-v-forsyth/) — QI denial is immediately appealable
- [Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304 (1995)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/117920/johnson-v-jones/) — Interlocutory appeal limited to legal questions, not factual sufficiency
- [Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U.S. 765 (2014)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2650722/plumhoff-v-rickard/) — Court can resolve both QI prongs on interlocutory appeal
