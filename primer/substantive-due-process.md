## What It Is

Substantive due process protects individuals from government conduct that is so arbitrary, egregious, or conscience-shocking that it violates fundamental fairness — regardless of what procedures were followed.

Unlike procedural due process (which asks "did you get a hearing?"), substantive due process asks "was this so outrageous that no hearing could make it okay?"

## The "Shocks the Conscience" Test

After [County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833 (1998)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118268/county-of-sacramento-v-lewis/), the standard for substantive due process in executive action cases is whether the conduct "shocks the conscience."

What that means depends on the context:

- **Deliberate decisions** (time to think): [Deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference) is enough — knowingly ignoring a serious risk
- **Split-second decisions** (urgent situations): Must show conduct intended to injure with no legitimate purpose — a much higher bar

A high-speed chase that kills a bystander? The officer had split seconds — you need to show intent to harm. A jail that ignores a diabetic inmate's insulin needs for a week? They had time to deliberate — deliberate indifference suffices.

## When to Use It

Substantive due process is a **residual** claim. Under [Graham v. Connor](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112257/graham-v-connor/), if a more specific constitutional provision applies (Fourth Amendment for seizures, Eighth Amendment for convicted prisoners), you use that instead.

Substantive due process fills the gaps:

- **Pretrial detainee conditions** — Not yet convicted, so Eighth Amendment doesn't apply
- **State-created danger** — Government action that creates or increases a risk of private violence
- **Conscience-shocking executive abuse** — Conduct that doesn't fit other amendments
- **Interference with bodily integrity** — Forced medical procedures, sexual abuse by officials

## State-Created Danger

Most circuits recognize a "state-created danger" theory: if a government official's affirmative acts create or substantially increase a danger to you, and they acted with deliberate indifference, there's a substantive due process claim — even though the ultimate harm came from a private actor.

Elements vary by circuit but generally require:

1. The state actor created or increased the danger
2. The plaintiff was a foreseeable victim
3. The state actor acted with deliberate indifference
4. The conduct shocks the conscience

## Key Cases

- [County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833 (1998)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118268/county-of-sacramento-v-lewis/) — "Shocks the conscience" standard
- [Rochin v. California, 342 U.S. 165 (1952)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/105050/rochin-v-california/) — Forced stomach pumping shocks the conscience
- [DeShaney v. Winnebago County, 489 U.S. 189 (1989)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112198/deshaney-v-winnebago-county-dept-of-social-services/) — No general duty to protect from private violence (but state-created danger is an exception in most circuits)
