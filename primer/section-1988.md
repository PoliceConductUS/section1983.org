## What It Is

42 U.S.C. § 1988 is the fee-shifting statute that accompanies [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983). It authorizes federal courts to award reasonable [attorney fees](/primer/attorneys-fees) to the "prevailing party" in civil rights cases.

Congress enacted § 1988 because it recognized that without fee-shifting, most civil rights violations would go unremedied — the damages are often too small to justify the cost of litigation.

## How It Works

- **Prevailing plaintiffs** receive fees as a matter of course, calculated by the [lodestar method](/primer/attorneys-fees) (reasonable hours × reasonable rate)
- **Prevailing defendants** receive fees only if the plaintiff's case was "frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation"
- The court has discretion to adjust the fee award based on the degree of success, complexity, and other factors

## Why It Matters

§ 1988 is supposed to be the engine that makes § 1983 work. Without it, only wealthy people could afford to enforce their constitutional rights. With it — in theory — attorneys have an incentive to take civil rights cases because the defendant pays the legal fees if the plaintiff wins.

In practice, the combination of [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity), the [nominal damages problem](/primer/nominal-damages), and judicial reduction of fee awards has significantly weakened this incentive. See [No One Will Take My § 1983 Case](/articles/no-one-will-take-my-case).
