## What It Is

The collateral order doctrine is an exception to the final judgment rule. It allows immediate appeal of court orders that are:

1. **Conclusive** — They conclusively determine the disputed question
2. **Separate** — They resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action
3. **Unreviewable** — They would be effectively unreviewable after final judgment

The doctrine comes from [Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/104715/cohen-v-beneficial-industrial-loan-corp/).

## In Practice

The collateral order doctrine is narrow. Courts apply it sparingly. The most significant application in § 1983 is the [interlocutory appeal](/primer/interlocutory-appeal) of qualified immunity denials — because the right to immunity from _suit_ (not just liability) would be irretrievably lost if the official had to go through trial.

Other recognized applications:

- Orders denying Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity
- Orders denying absolute immunity
- Some discovery orders involving privilege
