## What It Is

The plain view doctrine allows police officers to seize items — contraband, weapons, or evidence of a crime — without a warrant if those items are openly visible during an otherwise lawful encounter. It is one of several recognized exceptions to the [warrant requirement](/primer/warrant-requirement) under the [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment).

The idea is simple: if an officer is somewhere they have a legal right to be and they spot something obviously illegal, they shouldn't have to ignore it and go get a warrant.

## The Three Requirements

The Supreme Court laid out the test in [Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112568/horton-v-california/):

1. **Lawful presence** — The officer must be in a place they have a legal right to be (executing a warrant, conducting a [Terry stop](/primer/terry-stop), responding to an emergency, etc.).
2. **Immediately apparent** — The incriminating nature of the item must be "immediately apparent" without further searching or manipulation. The officer needs [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause) to believe the item is contraband or evidence of a crime.
3. **Lawful access** — The officer must be able to reach the item lawfully, not through additional unauthorized intrusion.

## What "Immediately Apparent" Means

This is where many plain view claims fail. The officer can't pick up an object, open a container, or move things around to figure out what something is. In [Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321 (1987)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111858/arizona-v-hicks/), the Supreme Court held that moving stereo equipment to read serial numbers was a "search" — not plain view — even though the officer was lawfully inside an apartment responding to a shooting.

If an officer says they saw drugs "in plain view" but they were actually inside a closed bag or hidden under clothing, the doctrine doesn't apply.

## Why It Matters in § 1983 Cases

If an officer [seized](/primer/seizure) your property by claiming it was in plain view but the requirements weren't met, that seizure may have violated the Fourth Amendment. Common challenges include:

- **The officer wasn't lawfully present** — They entered without a warrant, consent, or exigent circumstances.
- **It wasn't immediately apparent** — They had to manipulate or investigate the item to determine it was illegal.
- **They used it as a pretext** — They manufactured the "lawful presence" specifically to look for the item.

## Key Cases

- [Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112568/horton-v-california/) — Established the modern three-part test; eliminated the "inadvertent discovery" requirement
- [Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321 (1987)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111858/arizona-v-hicks/) — Moving objects to inspect them is a search, not plain view
- [Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443 (1971)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108444/coolidge-v-new-hampshire/) — Early formulation of the plain view doctrine
