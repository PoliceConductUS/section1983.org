## What It Is

Municipal liability is the umbrella term for holding local governments (cities, counties, school districts, etc.) liable under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983). The framework comes from [Monell](/primer/monell-liability) and its progeny.

## The Four Paths

### 1. Official Policy

A formally adopted policy, ordinance, regulation, or directive that itself violates the Constitution.

**Example**: A city policy requiring officers to strip-search all arrestees, regardless of the offense.

**Proof**: Find the written policy. It speaks for itself.

### 2. Widespread Custom or Practice

Conduct so persistent and widespread that it constitutes a "custom or usage" with the force of law, even without formal adoption.

**Example**: Officers in a department routinely use chokeholds during arrests, and supervisors know but don't stop it.

**Proof**: You need evidence of **multiple incidents** showing the practice is systemic — prior complaints, lawsuits, internal affairs findings, news reports, DOJ investigations.

### 3. Final Policymaker Decision

A single decision by a [final policymaker](/primer/final-policymaker) can create municipal liability.

**Example**: The police chief personally authorizes a warrantless raid.

**Proof**: Identify who has final authority under state/local law and show they made the decision.

### 4. Failure to Train or Supervise

When the municipality's failure to train or supervise its employees amounts to [deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference) to constitutional rights.

**Example**: A city never trains officers on when force is permitted, despite repeated excessive force incidents.

**Proof**: Show (a) the training was inadequate, (b) the inadequacy was obvious and likely to result in violations, and (c) the inadequacy actually caused the violation. [City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378 (1989)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112212/city-of-canton-v-harris/).

## Why Sue the City?

- **Money**: Individual officers may be judgment-proof. Cities have insurance and tax revenue.
- **No qualified immunity**: Municipalities cannot assert [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity). [Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S. 622 (1980)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110238/owen-v-city-of-independence/).
- **Systemic change**: Municipal liability is the path to policy reforms, consent decrees, and institutional accountability.
