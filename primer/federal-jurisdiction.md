## What It Is

Federal question jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. § 1331) gives federal district courts original jurisdiction over civil actions "arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States." Since § 1983 is a federal statute, your case qualifies automatically.

## Filing in Federal vs. State Court

You have a choice:

- **Federal court**: § 1983 cases are federal questions, so federal courts have jurisdiction
- **State court**: § 1983 claims can also be filed in state court. [Haywood v. Drown, 556 U.S. 729 (2009)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/145876/haywood-v-drown/) — States can't close their courts to § 1983 claims.

Most § 1983 plaintiffs choose federal court because:

- Federal judges have more experience with constitutional law
- Federal discovery rules are uniform
- Federal courts are perceived as less susceptible to local political pressure
- The Magistrate Judge system provides initial case management

If you file in state court, the defendant can **remove** the case to federal court under 28 U.S.C. § 1441, since it raises a federal question.

## Supplemental Jurisdiction

If you have state law claims related to the same incident (state tort claims, state constitutional violations), you can bring them in federal court under [supplemental jurisdiction](/primer/supplemental-jurisdiction) (28 U.S.C. § 1367). The federal and state claims must arise from the same "case or controversy."

But beware: if the court dismisses all your federal claims, it can (and often does) decline supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state claims, sending them back to state court.
