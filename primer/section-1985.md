42 U.S.C. § 1985 is the federal civil rights conspiracy statute. It has three subsections, but the one most relevant to police misconduct is **§ 1985(3)** — which makes it unlawful for two or more people to conspire to deprive someone of equal protection of the laws or equal privileges and immunities under the laws.

## How It's Different from § 1983

[Section 1983](/primer/section-1983) is the workhorse of civil rights litigation. It covers any constitutional violation committed by someone acting [under color of law](/primer/color-of-law). You don't need to prove the officer was motivated by racism or bias — just that they violated your rights.

Section 1985(3) is narrower and harder to prove. It adds a conspiracy element and — critically — requires **class-based discriminatory animus**. That means you must show the conspirators were motivated by hatred of or prejudice against a protected class.

|                              | § 1983                   | § 1985(3)                               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Who can be sued**          | State actors only        | State actors _and_ private individuals  |
| **Conspiracy required**      | No (but can allege one)  | Yes — two or more people                |
| **Discriminatory motive**    | Not required             | Required — must show class-based animus |
| **Constitutional violation** | Any constitutional right | Equal protection / equal privileges     |

## The Big Advantage: Reaching Private Actors

The most powerful feature of § 1985(3) is that it can reach **private individuals** — people who aren't government employees. Section 1983 only covers people acting under color of state law. But if a private citizen conspired with a police officer to violate your rights based on your race, § 1985(3) can reach both of them.

This matters in situations like:

- A private complainant who lied to police to get you arrested because of your race
- Private security working with police to target people of a particular race or religion
- Off-duty officers conspiring with civilians

## What You Have to Prove

To win a § 1985(3) claim, you need to show:

1. **A conspiracy** — two or more people agreed to deprive you of your rights. This doesn't require a formal plan. Circumstantial evidence (coordinated actions, shared motives, parallel behavior) can be enough.

2. **An act in furtherance** — at least one conspirator did something to carry out the conspiracy.

3. **Injury or deprivation** — you were actually harmed or deprived of a right.

4. **Class-based discriminatory animus** — this is the hard part. You must show the conspiracy was motivated by prejudice against a protected class. Race is the most clearly established basis. Courts have also recognized religion, national origin, and sex in some circuits, but the law varies.

## The Discriminatory Animus Problem

This requirement is what makes § 1985(3) difficult in practice. Even when race clearly played a role, proving it in court is challenging. Officers rarely announce their biases. You'll typically need to build the case through:

- **Statistical evidence** — patterns of disproportionate enforcement against your racial group
- **Statements by the defendants** — slurs, racially charged comments (in reports, on body camera, to witnesses)
- **Comparator evidence** — showing that people of a different race were treated differently in similar situations
- **Departmental patterns** — history of complaints or findings of racial bias
- **Context and timing** — the circumstances surrounding the incident that suggest racial motivation

## The Intracorporate Conspiracy Doctrine

There's a significant legal obstacle: many circuits hold that employees of a single entity (like officers in the same police department) cannot "conspire" with each other for purposes of § 1985(3). This is called the **[intracorporate conspiracy doctrine](/primer/intracorporate-conspiracy-doctrine)**. The theory is that a corporation can't conspire with itself.

Some circuits have carved out exceptions — particularly when officers acted outside the scope of their employment or had independent personal stakes. But this doctrine can be a barrier if all the conspirators work for the same department.

## When to Use § 1985(3)

Consider adding a § 1985(3) claim when:

- **Race or another protected class clearly motivated the conduct** — if you have evidence of slurs, racial profiling, or discriminatory patterns
- **Private actors were involved** — § 1983 can't reach them, but § 1985(3) can
- **Multiple people coordinated** — the conspiracy element is already there in your facts
- **You want to strengthen a § 1983 conspiracy claim** — alleging both gives the jury two legal theories for the same coordinated conduct

## When Not to Rely on It

Don't make § 1985(3) your primary claim if:

- You can't point to evidence of class-based motivation — courts will dismiss it early
- All defendants are officers in the same department — the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine may block you
- Your case is strong on § 1983 alone — adding a weak § 1985(3) claim can dilute your stronger arguments

## Attorney's Fees

If you prevail on a § 1985(3) claim, you can recover attorney's fees under [42 U.S.C. § 1988](/primer/section-1988), just like with § 1983.
