## Mental State Standard: Deliberate Indifference (for Failure to Train/Supervise)

The mental state standard for Monell depends on which theory you're using. For **official policy** or **final policymaker** claims, no separate mental state is required — the policy itself is the violation. But for **failure to train** or **failure to supervise** claims, you must show **[deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference)**: the municipality knew its training or supervision was inadequate and that the deficiency was likely to result in constitutional violations, yet chose to do nothing. _[City of Canton v. Harris](/cases/city-of-canton-v-harris)_, 489 U.S. 378 (1989).

See [State of Mind Requirements](/primer/state-of-mind) for how this compares to other § 1983 claims.

## What It Is

Monell liability is the doctrine that allows municipalities (cities, counties, school districts) to be sued under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983). It comes from [Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109881/monell-v-department-of-social-services/), which overruled part of Monroe v. Pape and held that local governments are "persons" under § 1983.

But there's a catch. A big one.

## The Policy-or-Custom Requirement

You can't sue a city just because its employee violated your rights. There's no respondeat superior — no automatic "the employer is liable for the employee's actions" — in § 1983.

To hold a municipality liable, you must show the violation resulted from:

1. **An official policy** — A formally adopted rule, regulation, or decision
2. **A widespread custom or practice** — Conduct so common and well-established that it effectively represents official policy, even without formal adoption
3. **A decision by a final policymaker** — A single decision by someone with final authority over the relevant area
4. **Failure to train or supervise** — amounting to [deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference) to constitutional rights

## Why It's Hard

Each path requires significant evidence:

- **Official policy**: Easy to identify if it exists. Harder if the unconstitutional practice is informal.
- **Custom or practice**: You typically need to show _multiple_ prior incidents of similar misconduct. One incident usually isn't enough.
- **Final policymaker**: You must identify _who_ has final decision-making authority under state law — not just who supervised the officer.
- **Failure to train**: After [City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378 (1989)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112212/city-of-canton-v-harris/), you must show the training deficiency is so obvious that the municipality was deliberately indifferent to the risk.

Most pro se plaintiffs try the "custom or practice" route. The problem: you need evidence of other incidents, which usually requires discovery. But defendants raise Monell at the motion to dismiss stage — before you get discovery.

## The Practical Reality

Cities know this doctrine protects them. Their typical strategy:

1. Argue qualified immunity for the individual officers
2. Argue no Monell liability for the city because you can't show a "policy or custom" from your complaint alone
3. Win on one or both and avoid a jury trial

Your counter: plead specific facts. Name the policymakers. Reference prior incidents if you know about them. Cite any public records — news reports, prior lawsuits, DOJ investigations — showing a pattern.

## Key Cases

- [Monell v. Dep't of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109881/monell-v-department-of-social-services/) — Municipalities are "persons" under § 1983
- [City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378 (1989)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112212/city-of-canton-v-harris/) — Failure to train requires deliberate indifference
- [Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469 (1986)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111639/pembaur-v-city-of-cincinnati/) — Single decision by final policymaker can establish Monell
- [Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51 (2011)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/209802/connick-v-thompson/) — Narrowed failure-to-train liability; single Brady violation insufficient
