## What It Is

Collateral estoppel (also called issue preclusion) prevents a party from relitigating an issue that was **actually decided** in a prior proceeding. If a court already determined that Officer Smith lacked probable cause to arrest you (say, in a suppression hearing), the city can't argue he had probable cause in your § 1983 case.

## The Elements

The typical test requires:

1. **The issue is identical** to one decided in the prior proceeding
2. **The issue was actually litigated and decided** (not defaulted or stipulated)
3. **The determination was essential** to the judgment in the prior case
4. **The party against whom estoppel is asserted** had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue

## Offensive vs. Defensive Use

- **Defensive**: Defendant uses a prior ruling to prevent plaintiff from relitigating an issue plaintiff already lost
- **Offensive**: Plaintiff uses a prior ruling to prevent defendant from relitigating an issue defendant already lost

[Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322 (1979)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109962/parklane-hosiery-co-v-shore/) — The Supreme Court approved offensive collateral estoppel, with the judge retaining discretion to deny it when it would be unfair.

## Using Criminal Proceedings in § 1983

This is where collateral estoppel gets powerful for § 1983 plaintiffs:

- **Suppression hearing**: If the criminal court suppressed evidence because the officer lacked probable cause, that finding can preclude the city from arguing probable cause existed in your civil case
- **Acquittal**: A jury acquittal doesn't necessarily establish collateral estoppel (general verdicts don't specify which issues were decided)
- **Dismissal**: A simple dismissal usually doesn't create collateral estoppel because no issue was "actually litigated"

The key: was the specific issue **actually decided** after full litigation? A suppression ruling with detailed findings of fact is gold. A nolle prosequi is not.

## Strategic Value

If you won a suppression hearing or other pretrial ruling in your criminal case, save every document. The order, the transcript, the briefing — all of it supports your collateral estoppel argument in the § 1983 case.

- [Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322 (1979)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109962/parklane-hosiery-co-v-shore/) — Offensive collateral estoppel approved
