## What It Is

A declaratory judgment is a court ruling that declares the legal rights and obligations of the parties without ordering any specific action or awarding damages. Under 28 U.S.C. § 2201, you can ask a federal court to declare that a government policy, practice, or action violates the Constitution.

## When to Use It

- **Challenge an ongoing policy** — "The city's strip-search policy violates the Fourth Amendment"
- **Establish your rights** — "The arrest on December 4 violated plaintiff's First Amendment rights"
- **Prevent future violations** — Combined with [injunctive relief](/primer/injunctive-relief), a declaratory judgment establishes the legal framework for enforcement

## Advantages

- **Lower standing threshold than injunctions** — You may not need to show the violation will recur (required for injunctive relief under [Lyons](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110896/city-of-los-angeles-v-lyons/))
- **Establishes the record** — Even if you get no money, a declaratory judgment establishes that the violation occurred — which can support future litigation
- **Prevailing party status** — A favorable declaratory judgment may make you a prevailing party for [attorney fees](/primer/attorneys-fees) under § 1988

## Limitations

- Must have an active "case or controversy" — purely past violations with no ongoing effect may be moot
- Defendants may argue the issue is academic if the policy has changed

## Key Cases
