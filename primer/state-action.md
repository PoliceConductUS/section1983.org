## What It Is

The Constitution restricts **government** action, not private conduct. The state action doctrine determines when conduct by a private entity or individual is sufficiently connected to the government to trigger constitutional protections.

For [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983), this overlaps with the [color of law](/primer/color-of-law) requirement. A private security guard who beats you isn't acting under color of law — unless they were deputized, working under government contract, or acting jointly with police.

## When Private Actors Become State Actors

Courts have recognized several tests:

1. **Public function**: The private party performs a function "traditionally exclusively reserved to the State." Running a prison qualifies. Running a shopping mall doesn't.
2. **Joint action**: The private party acts jointly or in concert with government officials. An off-duty officer moonlighting as private security who uses police authority may be a state actor.
3. **Nexus/entwinement**: The state is so entwined with the private entity that the private conduct is effectively state action.
4. **Compulsion**: The state compelled or coerced the private party's conduct.

## Why It Matters

If the person who violated your rights isn't a state actor, you can't bring a § 1983 claim. Period. This matters when dealing with:

- Private security companies
- Private prison operators
- Hospital staff in government-contracted facilities
- Tow truck drivers acting at police direction
- Informants working with police
