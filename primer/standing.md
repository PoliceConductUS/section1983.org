## What It Is

Standing is a threshold requirement under Article III of the U.S. Constitution. Before a federal court will hear your § 1983 case, you must show that you are the **right person** to bring the lawsuit. It's not enough that something bad happened — you must show it happened **to you** and that the court can do something about it.

## The Three Requirements

The Supreme Court established the modern standing test in [Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/). You must prove:

1. **Injury in fact** — You suffered a concrete, particularized injury that is actual or imminent, not hypothetical. A broken arm from excessive force qualifies. A vague fear that police might someday violate your rights does not.

2. **Causation (traceability)** — Your injury must be fairly traceable to the defendant's conduct. You must connect the specific officer or municipality to the harm you suffered.

3. **Redressability** — A favorable court decision must be likely to fix or compensate for your injury. If winning the case wouldn't help you, you lack standing.

## Standing in § 1983 Cases

Most § 1983 cases involve **past injuries** (excessive force, false arrest, illegal search), so standing is usually straightforward — you were hurt, the defendant did it, and money damages would compensate you.

Standing gets trickier when you seek **injunctive relief** (asking the court to order the government to change a policy). You must show a **real and immediate threat** of future injury, not just that you were harmed in the past. [City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95 (1983)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110924/city-of-los-angeles-v-lyons/) — a man who was subjected to a police chokehold lacked standing to seek an injunction against the chokehold policy because he could not show he was likely to be choked again.

## Organizational Standing

Civil rights organizations can sometimes sue on behalf of their members if: (1) at least one member has standing, (2) the interests are related to the organization's purpose, and (3) individual member participation is not required. [Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Commission, 432 U.S. 333 (1977)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109685/hunt-v-washington-state-apple-advertising-commn/).

## Practical Tips

- **Be specific about your injury.** Describe exactly what happened to you and what harm resulted.
- **Name the right defendants.** Your injury must be traceable to the people you sue.
- **If seeking an injunction**, explain why you face a real threat of future harm — not just past harm.
- **Standing is checked throughout the case.** If your situation changes (see [mootness](/primer/mootness)), you can lose standing.

## Key Takeaway

To have standing, show a real injury caused by the defendant that the court can remedy. Without standing, your case will be dismissed before it begins.
