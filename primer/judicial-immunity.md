## What It Is

Judicial immunity is a form of [absolute immunity](/primer/absolute-immunity) that protects judges from § 1983 liability for acts performed in their judicial capacity. It applies even if the judge acted erroneously, corruptly, or maliciously.

[Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349 (1978)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109821/stump-v-sparkman/) is the extreme example: a judge who approved a petition to sterilize a 15-year-old girl — without her knowledge — was absolutely immune because the act was "judicial" in nature and he had jurisdiction over the subject matter.

## The Two Exceptions

Judicial immunity does not apply when:

1. **The act was not judicial** — Administrative or executive acts (hiring, firing, budget decisions) don't get absolute immunity
2. **The judge acted in the complete absence of jurisdiction** — Not just an error in jurisdiction, but truly no jurisdiction at all (e.g., a traffic court judge ordering someone imprisoned for a felony)

These exceptions are extremely narrow. In practice, judicial immunity is nearly impenetrable.

## Your Remedies

If a judge violates your rights:

- **Appeal** the decision
- **File a judicial conduct complaint** with the state judicial conduct commission
- **Mandamus** — In rare cases, you can petition a higher court to compel the judge to act
- **Recusal motion** — If the judge is biased, move for recusal under 28 U.S.C. § 455

## Key Cases

- [Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349 (1978)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109821/stump-v-sparkman/) — Judicial immunity even for outrageous acts
- [Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9 (1991)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112703/mireles-v-waco/) — Judge who ordered police to seize attorney — immune
- [Forrester v. White, 484 U.S. 219 (1988)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112053/forrester-v-white/) — Administrative acts (firing a probation officer) get only qualified immunity
