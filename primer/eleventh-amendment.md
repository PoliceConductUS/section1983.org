## What It Is

The Eleventh Amendment bars federal courts from hearing lawsuits against a state brought by its own citizens or citizens of another state. This means you generally **cannot sue the state** or a state agency under § 1983 for money damages.

## What It Blocks

- Suits against the state itself
- Suits against state agencies (Department of Corrections, state police, state university)
- Suits against state officials in their **official capacity** for money damages (because that's effectively a suit against the state)

## What It Doesn't Block

- Suits against **municipalities** (cities, counties, school districts) — the Eleventh Amendment only protects states, not local governments. [Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109881/monell-v-department-of-social-services/).
- Suits against state officials in their **[individual capacity](/primer/individual-capacity)** — you're suing the person, not the state
- Suits against state officials in their **[official capacity](/primer/official-capacity)** for **injunctive relief** (an order to stop doing something) — the [Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/96770/ex-parte-young/) exception
- Cases where the state has **waived** its immunity (rare)
- Cases where Congress has **abrogated** sovereign immunity under the Fourteenth Amendment (§ 1983 does not do this)

## Why It Matters

Most § 1983 plaintiffs don't sue the state directly. You sue:

1. Individual officers in their [individual capacity](/primer/individual-capacity) (for money damages)
2. The municipality (for money damages, under [Monell](/primer/monell-liability))
3. Officials in their [official capacity](/primer/official-capacity) (for injunctive relief only)

If you accidentally name the state or a state agency, that claim gets dismissed. Name the right defendants from the start.

## Key Cases

- [Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/96770/ex-parte-young/) — State officials can be sued for injunctive relief
- [Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58 (1989)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112271/will-v-michigan-dept-of-state-police/) — States are not "persons" under § 1983; official capacity suits against state officials for damages barred
- [Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108981/edelman-v-jordan/) — Eleventh Amendment bars retroactive monetary relief from states
