## What It Is

A Franks violation occurs when an officer includes **material false statements** — or omits critical facts — in a warrant affidavit, and the warrant would not have been issued without the falsehood. The name comes from [Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109965/franks-v-delaware/).

In plain terms: if a police officer lied to get a search warrant, or deliberately left out information that would have changed the judge's mind, the warrant — and everything found because of it — may be invalid.

## The Two-Part Test

To establish a Franks violation, you must show:

1. **The officer made a false statement (or omission) knowingly, intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth** — Honest mistakes don't count. You need to show the officer either knew the statement was false or didn't care whether it was true.

2. **The false statement was material** — If you remove the lie (or add back the omitted information), the remaining affidavit doesn't support [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause). In other words, the falsehood actually mattered to the judge's decision.

## How to Raise a Franks Challenge

In criminal cases, defendants request a "Franks hearing" to challenge the warrant. In a § 1983 civil rights case, the Franks analysis works differently — you're suing the officer for violating the [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment) by obtaining a warrant through deception.

You'll need evidence showing what the officer said in the affidavit versus what actually happened. Useful sources include:

- **Body camera footage** contradicting the affidavit
- **Witness statements** that differ from what the officer claimed
- **Police reports** that conflict with the affidavit
- **Records showing the officer omitted exculpatory information**

## Why It Matters in § 1983 Cases

Officers who fabricate warrant affidavits are not protected by [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) in most circuits — it has been [clearly established](/primer/clearly-established-law) for decades that lying to obtain a warrant violates the Fourth Amendment. See [Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335 (1986)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111627/malley-v-briggs/).

Common scenarios:

- **Fabricated informant tips** — The officer claimed an informant provided information that didn't exist
- **Exaggerated observations** — The officer inflated what they saw to manufacture probable cause
- **Omitted contradictory evidence** — The officer knew facts that undermined probable cause but left them out
- **Stale information presented as current** — Using old information as if it were fresh

## Key Cases

- [Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109965/franks-v-delaware/) — Established the right to challenge warrant affidavits containing deliberate falsehoods
- [Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335 (1986)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111627/malley-v-briggs/) — Officers can be liable for obtaining a warrant no reasonable officer would have sought
- [Kalina v. Fletcher, 522 U.S. 118 (1997)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118174/kalina-v-fletcher/) — No absolute immunity for officers who prepare false warrant affidavits
