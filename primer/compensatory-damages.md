## What It Is

Compensatory damages in § 1983 are money awards designed to compensate you for the actual harm caused by the constitutional violation. They aim to make you "whole" — to restore you to the position you would have been in had the violation not occurred.

## Categories

### Economic (Special) Damages

Quantifiable financial losses:

- **Medical expenses** — Hospital bills, therapy, medication
- **Lost wages** — Time missed from work due to arrest, injury, or detention
- **Property damage** — Belongings destroyed during a search or arrest
- **Legal expenses** — Costs of defending against wrongful criminal charges (separate from § 1988 attorney fees)

### Non-Economic (General) Damages

Subjective harms that don't have a specific dollar amount:

- **Pain and suffering** — Physical pain from excessive force
- **Emotional distress** — Anxiety, depression, PTSD, humiliation
- **Loss of liberty** — The experience of being unlawfully confined
- **Reputational harm** — Damage to your reputation from a wrongful arrest or prosecution
- **Loss of enjoyment of life** — How the violation changed your daily existence

## Proving Damages

- **Document everything** — Medical records, therapy records, pay stubs showing lost income, photos of injuries
- **Get treatment** — If you're injured, seek medical care. If you're suffering emotionally, see a therapist. Untreated injuries are harder to prove.
- **Keep a journal** — Document how the incident affects your daily life. This becomes evidence of emotional distress.
- **Expert testimony** — Medical experts and economists can quantify damages, but this costs money

## The Emotional Distress Challenge

You can recover for emotional distress without physical injury in most circuits — but you need evidence. Your testimony alone may suffice, but it's stronger with:

- Medical/therapy records
- Testimony from family or friends about changes in your behavior
- Documentation of nightmares, anxiety, avoidance behavior

For prisoners, the [PLRA](/primer/plra) requires a showing of physical injury before recovering for emotional distress, which effectively bars many legitimate claims.

## Key Cases

- [Memphis Community School District v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299 (1986)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111724/memphis-community-school-dist-v-stachura/) — Compensatory damages based on actual injury, not the abstract "value" of the right violated
- [Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247 (1978)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109811/carey-v-piphus/) — Must prove actual injury for compensatory damages; procedural due process violation without injury yields only nominal damages
