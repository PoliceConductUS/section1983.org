## What It Is

A demand letter is a formal letter sent to the potential defendant before filing suit, describing what happened, what constitutional rights were violated, and what you want (usually money, policy changes, or both).

## Is It Required?

No. You don't need to send a demand letter before filing a § 1983 case. There's no [exhaustion](/primer/exhaustion-of-remedies) requirement for non-prisoners. But there are strategic reasons to send one — and reasons not to.

## Reasons to Send One

- **Settlement without litigation** — Some cities will settle early to avoid the cost and publicity of a lawsuit
- **Preservation trigger** — A demand letter puts the defendant on notice to preserve evidence (body camera footage, communications, records)
- **Shows good faith** — Demonstrates you attempted to resolve the dispute before resorting to litigation
- **Establishes your narrative** — Forces the city to respond to your version of events early

## Reasons Not to Send One

- **Tips off the defendant** — Gives them time to prepare, coordinate stories, and get legal counsel before you file
- **Runs the clock** — If you're close to the [statute of limitations](/primer/statute-of-limitations), don't waste time on a demand letter. File first.
- **May not be taken seriously** — Without an attorney's letterhead, government entities often ignore demand letters from individuals

## What to Include

If you send one:

- Clear factual summary of the incident
- Identification of the officers involved
- Specific constitutional violations
- Demand for preservation of all evidence
- Specific relief requested (dollar amount, policy changes)
- Deadline for response (30 days is standard)
- Statement that you will file suit if the demand is not met

## What Not to Include

- Threats beyond filing a lawsuit
- Inflammatory language or personal attacks
- Speculation about facts you can't prove
- Your entire legal theory (save that for the complaint)
