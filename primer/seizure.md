## What It Is

A "seizure" under the [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment) happens when the government meaningfully restricts your freedom of movement. This can range from a brief [Terry stop](/primer/terry-stop) on the sidewalk to a full custodial arrest. The concept matters because the Fourth Amendment only protects you from **unreasonable** seizures — so the first question is always: _were you seized at all?_

## The Legal Test

The Supreme Court established the standard in [United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544 (1980)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110293/united-states-v-mendenhall/): a seizure occurs when, considering all the circumstances, **a reasonable person would not feel free to leave or to decline the officer's requests**.

Factors that indicate a seizure include:

- **Physical touching** by the officer
- **Display of a weapon**
- **Commands or authoritative tone** ("Stop!" "Don't move!")
- **Blocking your path** with a vehicle or body
- **Retaining your documents** (ID, license, passport)
- **Multiple officers** surrounding you

A friendly conversation where you're free to walk away is **not** a seizure. But the moment an officer uses authority to make you stay, it likely becomes one.

## Physical Force as Seizure

In [Torres v. Madrid, 592 U.S. 306 (2021)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4588526/torres-v-madrid/), the Supreme Court held that shooting someone is a seizure — even if the person escapes and isn't actually stopped. The application of **physical force with intent to restrain** is enough, regardless of whether it succeeds.

This is important for [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force) claims: you don't need to prove the officer successfully detained you to argue the Fourth Amendment applies.

## Types of Seizures

Seizures exist on a spectrum:

- **Consensual encounter** — Not a seizure. You're free to leave. No Fourth Amendment protections apply.
- **Investigatory stop (Terry stop)** — Brief seizure requiring [reasonable suspicion](/primer/reasonable-suspicion). Limited in scope and duration.
- **De facto arrest** — A stop that becomes so prolonged or intrusive it crosses into an arrest, requiring [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause).
- **Formal arrest** — Full custodial seizure requiring probable cause.

## Why It Matters in § 1983 Cases

Before you can bring a Fourth Amendment claim — whether for [false arrest](/primer/false-arrest), excessive force, or unlawful detention — you generally need to show that a seizure occurred. If the government argues you were "free to leave," they're trying to avoid Fourth Amendment scrutiny entirely.

Key questions to ask:

- Would a reasonable person have felt free to leave?
- Did the officer use physical force or a show of authority?
- How long were you detained, and under what conditions?

## Key Cases

- [Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/) — Established that brief investigatory stops are seizures requiring reasonable suspicion
- [United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544 (1980)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110293/united-states-v-mendenhall/) — "Free to leave" test for seizures
- [Torres v. Madrid, 592 U.S. 306 (2021)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4588526/torres-v-madrid/) — Physical force with intent to restrain is a seizure even if unsuccessful
- [California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621 (1991)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112625/california-v-hodari-d/) — For show-of-authority seizures, submission is required
