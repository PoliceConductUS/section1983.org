## What It Is

When a defendant [removes](/primer/removal) your case from state court to federal court, you can ask the federal judge to **send it back**. This is called remand, and it is governed by 28 U.S.C. § 1447.

## When Remand Is Available

A federal court **must** remand a case if:

- **The court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.** If the case does not belong in federal court, it must go back. This can be raised at any time.
- **There was a procedural defect** in the removal process — for example, the defendant missed the 30-day deadline or not all defendants consented. You must raise procedural defects **within 30 days** of the removal notice. [28 U.S.C. § 1447(c)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1447).

## Remand in § 1983 Cases

Remand is **less common** in § 1983 cases because these claims clearly arise under federal law, giving the federal court jurisdiction. However, remand may still succeed if:

- The defendant removed **too late** (after the 30-day window)
- **Not all defendants joined** in the removal notice
- The case involves only **state-law claims** and the federal claims have been dismissed, leaving no reason for the federal court to keep it

## The Procedure

1. **File a motion to remand** in the federal court where the case was removed.
2. **Explain the defect** — lack of jurisdiction or procedural error.
3. **Request attorney's fees.** Under § 1447(c), the court may award costs and fees if the removal lacked an objectively reasonable basis. [Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., 546 U.S. 132 (2005)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/145575/martin-v-franklin-capital-corp/).

## Can the Remand Order Be Appealed?

Generally, **no**. An order remanding a case to state court is usually **not appealable**. [Thermtron Products, Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S. 336 (1976)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109340/thermtron-products-inc-v-hermansdorfer/) carved out narrow exceptions, but in most cases the remand order is final.

## Practical Tips

- **Act quickly.** You have only **30 days** after the notice of removal to raise procedural defects.
- **Jurisdictional arguments have no deadline** — you can raise lack of subject matter jurisdiction at any time.
- **Ask for fees** if the removal was clearly improper. Courts can award costs under § 1447(c).
- **Consider whether you even want remand.** Federal court can be a good forum for § 1983 claims. Think strategically before fighting to go back to state court.

## Key Takeaway

If a defendant improperly removes your case, you can file a motion to remand within 30 days. But for § 1983 claims, federal court is often where you want to be anyway.
