## What It Is

[Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223 (2009)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/145906/pearson-v-callahan/) overruled the mandatory two-step sequence from _Saucier v. Katz_ and gave courts discretion to resolve qualified immunity on **either prong** without addressing the other.

Before Pearson, under [Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194 (2001)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118445/saucier-v-katz/), courts had to answer the constitutional question first: _Did the officer violate a constitutional right?_ Only then could they ask whether the right was clearly established.

Saucier's logic was straightforward: if courts always decide the constitutional question, they build precedent. Future plaintiffs can point to those decisions to show the right was "clearly established."

## What Pearson Changed

Pearson let courts skip the constitutional question entirely and jump straight to "not clearly established." The court can say: "We don't need to decide whether this was a constitutional violation because even if it was, the law wasn't clearly established."

## Why It Matters

This is the engine of the qualified immunity ratchet:

1. Novel violation occurs
2. Court skips the constitutional question → goes to "clearly established"
3. No prior case on point → not clearly established → QI granted
4. **No precedent created** because the court never ruled on the constitutional question
5. Next plaintiff with the same violation faces the same "not clearly established" problem

Rights that courts refuse to address can never become clearly established. Pearson gave courts permission to avoid hard constitutional questions, and many of them took it.

## The Numbers

Studies have shown that after Pearson, courts dramatically reduced their willingness to decide constitutional questions in QI cases. The result: fewer new rights get "clearly established," making QI harder to overcome over time.
