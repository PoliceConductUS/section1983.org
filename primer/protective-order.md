## What It Is

A protective order under Federal Rule 26(c) limits the use or disclosure of information obtained during [discovery](/primer/discovery). The court can issue one upon a showing of "good cause" to protect a party from "annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden."

## How Defendants Use Them

Government defendants in § 1983 cases routinely seek protective orders to:

- Prevent you from sharing body camera footage publicly
- Keep internal affairs files confidential
- Restrict disclosure of officer personnel records
- Prevent media access to discovery materials

## How to Respond

Protective orders aren't automatic. The defendant must show **good cause** — not just assert it. Arguments against overbroad protective orders:

- **Public interest** — Police misconduct is a matter of public concern. The public has a right to know how its officers behave.
- **First Amendment** — Broad gag orders on discovery materials may implicate free speech
- **Narrowly tailored** — Even if some protection is warranted (e.g., Social Security numbers, home addresses), it shouldn't cover the substance of the misconduct
- **Propose a tiered order** — Agree to redact personal information while keeping the substantive facts public

## The Practical Impact

If you agree to a broad protective order, you may not be able to:

- Share evidence with journalists
- Post body camera footage online
- Discuss the details of what you found in discovery
- Help future plaintiffs suing the same officer

Think carefully before agreeing. Negotiate narrow terms that protect legitimate privacy interests (officer home addresses, witness personal information) without hiding misconduct.

## Key Rules

- **Rule 26(c)** — Protective orders
- **Rule 5.2** — Privacy protections for filings (SSNs, minors' names, financial accounts)
