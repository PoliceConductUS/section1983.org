## What It Is

A settlement is a negotiated resolution of a lawsuit before trial (or sometimes during trial). The vast majority of § 1983 cases that survive the motion to dismiss stage settle rather than going to trial.

## When It Happens

Settlement can occur at any point:

- **Before filing** — Demand letter leads to negotiation
- **After filing, before discovery** — Defendant wants to avoid disclosure
- **During discovery** — Evidence emerges that shifts the balance
- **After summary judgment** — If your claims survive, the defendant's risk increases substantially
- **At mediation** — Many courts require mediation before trial
- **On the courthouse steps** — The day of trial

## What to Watch For

### Gag Clauses (Non-Disclosure Agreements)

Defendants — especially municipalities — often demand confidentiality as a condition of settlement. They don't want the public to know what the officer did or how much they paid.

Think carefully before agreeing. A confidential settlement means:

- You can't talk publicly about what happened
- The officer's misconduct stays hidden
- Future victims of the same officer can't find out about your case
- The pattern evidence that future [Monell](/primer/monell-liability) plaintiffs need doesn't exist

### No-Admission Clauses

Almost every settlement includes language like "defendant admits no wrongdoing." This is standard and usually non-negotiable. What you _can_ negotiate: whether the settlement is public, whether policy changes are required, whether the officer receives discipline.

### Attorney Fee Waivers

In [Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U.S. 717 (1986)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111643/evans-v-jeff-d/), the Supreme Court allowed defendants to condition settlement on the plaintiff waiving [attorney fees](/primer/attorneys-fees). This means: "We'll pay you $50,000, but only if you agree your lawyer gets nothing."

This practice is widely condemned but still legal.

### Indemnification

Check whether the settlement is paid by the officer or the city. In almost all cases, the city pays — even for individual officer misconduct. This means the officer faces no personal financial consequence.

## Negotiation Tips

- **Don't settle too early** — Before discovery, you don't know the full extent of the evidence. The defendant does.
- **Know your bottom line** — What's the minimum you'll accept? Factor in the emotional cost of continued litigation.
- **Consider non-monetary terms** — Policy changes, training requirements, officer discipline, public acknowledgment of wrongdoing
- **Get it in writing** — Every term, every detail. Oral agreements are worthless.
- **Have someone review it** — Even if you're pro se, consider having an attorney review the settlement agreement before you sign.

## Key Cases

- [Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U.S. 717 (1986)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111643/evans-v-jeff-d/) — Fee waivers in settlement are permissible
- [Marek v. Chesny, 473 U.S. 1 (1985)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111538/marek-v-chesny/) — Rule 68 offer of judgment and its effect on attorney fees
