## What It Is

A § 1983 malicious prosecution claim alleges that the defendant initiated or continued criminal proceedings against you **without probable cause** and with **malice**, causing you to suffer a seizure of your person (arrest, pretrial detention, restrictions on liberty).

After [Thompson v. Clark, 596 U.S. 36 (2022)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/8560153/thompson-v-clark/), malicious prosecution claims under § 1983 are grounded in the **Fourth Amendment**.

## Mental State Standard: Objective (Plus Malice in Some Circuits)

Malicious prosecution is grounded in the **Fourth Amendment** after _Thompson v. Clark_, so the probable cause analysis uses an **objective reasonableness** standard — would a reasonable officer have believed probable cause existed to initiate or continue the prosecution?

However, some circuits also require **malice** — meaning the officer brought or continued the charges with an improper purpose (to harass, retaliate, or punish) rather than a legitimate law enforcement motive. Not all circuits require malice as a separate element, so check your [circuit's case law](/primer/federal-circuit-courts).

See [State of Mind Requirements](/primer/state-of-mind) for how this compares to other § 1983 claims.

## The Elements

After Thompson v. Clark and circuit precedent:

1. **The defendant initiated or continued a criminal proceeding against you**
2. **The proceeding terminated in your favor** — but you don't need an affirmative indication of innocence; a dismissal is enough (Thompson v. Clark)
3. **There was no probable cause**
4. **The proceeding was brought with malice** (some circuits don't require this separately)
5. **You suffered a Fourth Amendment seizure** as a result

## The Thompson v. Clark Fix

Before Thompson, circuits were split on what "favorable termination" meant. Some required an affirmative statement of innocence — a full acquittal or a dismissal specifically based on insufficient evidence. A dismissal "in the interest of justice" might not count.

Thompson fixed this: you need only show the criminal prosecution ended **without a conviction**. No affirmative indication of innocence required. This lowered a significant barrier for § 1983 plaintiffs.

## The Practical Challenge

Malicious prosecution is harder to prove than unlawful arrest because:

- You must show the **entire prosecution** lacked probable cause, not just the initial arrest
- You must wait for the criminal case to **end** before suing (and the [statute of limitations](/primer/statute-of-limitations) clock starts at termination)
- Prosecutors have [absolute immunity](/primer/absolute-immunity) for the decision to prosecute — so your claim usually targets the **officer** who initiated the proceedings, not the prosecutor

## When to Bring It

Malicious prosecution is especially strong when:

- Charges were dropped or dismissed
- The criminal case was weak from the start
- Officers fabricated evidence or omitted exculpatory information in the arrest warrant or complaint
- The arrest was retaliatory (overlap with [First Amendment retaliation](/primer/first-amendment-retaliation))

## Key Cases

- [Thompson v. Clark, 596 U.S. 36 (2022)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/8560153/thompson-v-clark/) — Favorable termination doesn't require affirmative innocence indication
- [Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266 (1994)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112960/albright-v-oliver/) — § 1983 malicious prosecution grounded in specific constitutional provisions, not substantive due process
- [Manuel v. City of Joliet, 580 U.S. 357 (2017)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/8403081/manuel-v-city-of-joliet-illinois/) — Pretrial detention without probable cause violates the Fourth Amendment
