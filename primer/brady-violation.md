## What It Is

A Brady violation occurs when the prosecution suppresses evidence that is **favorable to the defendant** and **material to guilt or punishment**. The rule comes from [Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/106681/brady-v-maryland/).

## The Three Elements

1. **The evidence is favorable** — It's exculpatory (shows innocence) or impeaching (undermines a prosecution witness's credibility)
2. **The prosecution suppressed it** — They didn't disclose it to the defense, whether intentionally or inadvertently
3. **The evidence is material** — There's a reasonable probability that the outcome would have been different if it had been disclosed

## Why It Matters for § 1983

Brady violations can form the basis of a § 1983 claim. If police officers or prosecutors fabricated evidence or concealed exculpatory material, and you were prosecuted or convicted as a result, you may have a due process claim under the [Fourteenth Amendment](/primer/fourteenth-amendment).

But there's a brutal catch: the prosecutor who suppressed the evidence is likely shielded by [absolute immunity](/primer/absolute-immunity). Your § 1983 claim targets the **officers** who withheld evidence from the prosecution or fabricated it — not the prosecutor who failed to turn it over.

## The Connick Problem

[Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51 (2011)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/209802/connick-v-thompson/) held that a single Brady violation cannot establish [Monell](/primer/monell-liability) failure-to-train liability against a DA's office. Thompson spent 14 years on death row because prosecutors hid blood evidence. He won $14 million at trial. The Supreme Court reversed 5-4.

## Key Cases

- [Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/106681/brady-v-maryland/) — Prosecution must disclose favorable evidence
- [Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108491/giglio-v-united-states/) — Extended Brady to impeachment evidence
- [Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263 (1999)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118330/strickler-v-greene/) — Three-part Brady test
- [Connick v. Thompson, 563 U.S. 51 (2011)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/209802/connick-v-thompson/) — Single Brady violation insufficient for Monell
