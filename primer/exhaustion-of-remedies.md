## What It Is

Exhaustion requires a plaintiff to pursue available administrative or state remedies before filing a federal lawsuit. The question: do you have to file a complaint with internal affairs, go through a grievance process, or sue in state court first?

## The General Rule: No Exhaustion Required

For most § 1983 cases, **no exhaustion is required**. [Patsy v. Board of Regents, 457 U.S. 496 (1982)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110831/patsy-v-board-of-regents-of-florida/) — The Supreme Court held that § 1983 plaintiffs do not need to exhaust state administrative remedies before filing in federal court.

You don't need to:

- File an internal affairs complaint
- Go through a civilian review board
- Sue in state court first
- File a grievance

## The Big Exception: Prisoners

The [Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA)](/primer/plra), 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a), **does** require prisoners to exhaust available administrative remedies before filing a § 1983 suit. This means going through the jail or prison's grievance system — each step of it — before you can file in federal court.

The PLRA exhaustion requirement is strictly enforced. If you skip a step, file late, or don't follow the grievance procedures exactly, your case gets dismissed.

## Why It Matters

For non-prisoners: good news. You can file your § 1983 case immediately. Don't wait for internal investigations, don't wait for the city to respond to your complaint. File.

For prisoners: the exhaustion requirement is a significant barrier. Grievance systems are often designed to be difficult to navigate, and any procedural misstep can kill your case.

## Key Cases

- [Patsy v. Board of Regents, 457 U.S. 496 (1982)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110831/patsy-v-board-of-regents-of-florida/) — No exhaustion required for § 1983
- [Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81 (2006)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/145637/woodford-v-ngo/) — PLRA requires "proper exhaustion" of all available administrative remedies
- [Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. 632 (2016)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/3571860/ross-v-blake/) — Exhaustion required only of "available" remedies; if the grievance system is effectively unavailable, exhaustion isn't required
