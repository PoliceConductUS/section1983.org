## What It Is

Exigent circumstances are **emergency situations** where requiring police to get a [warrant](/primer/warrant-requirement) would be impractical or dangerous. When true exigent circumstances exist, officers can conduct a search or seizure without a warrant and the action is still considered reasonable under the [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment).

## Recognized Categories

Courts recognize several types of exigent circumstances:

### Imminent Danger to Life

Police may enter without a warrant when they reasonably believe someone inside is in **immediate danger of serious harm or death**. [Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U.S. 398 (2006)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/145612/brigham-city-v-stuart/) — officers who saw a fight through a window could enter without a warrant to prevent serious injury.

### Imminent Destruction of Evidence

If police reasonably believe evidence is about to be **destroyed**, they may act without a warrant. However, police **cannot create the exigency themselves**. [Kentucky v. King, 563 U.S. 452 (2011)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/218041/kentucky-v-king/) held that police knocking on a door and hearing movement inside could justify entry — but only because they didn't create the emergency through actual or threatened Fourth Amendment violations.

### Hot Pursuit

When police are in **hot pursuit of a fleeing suspect**, they can follow the suspect into a building without a warrant. But the Supreme Court limited this in [Lange v. California, 594 U.S. 295 (2021)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4555961/lange-v-california/) — pursuit of a **misdemeanor** suspect does not automatically create exigent circumstances. Courts must evaluate the totality of the circumstances.

### Preventing Escape

Officers may act without a warrant if a suspect is about to flee and delay would result in the suspect escaping justice.

## The Government Bears the Burden

When police act without a warrant, **they must justify the warrantless action**. The government has the burden of proving that exigent circumstances actually existed. [Welsh v. Wisconsin, 466 U.S. 740 (1984)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111136/welsh-v-wisconsin/).

## Police Cannot Create the Emergency

A critical limitation: police **cannot manufacture exigent circumstances** to avoid the warrant requirement. If officers deliberately create the emergency as a pretext to enter without a warrant, the exception does not apply.

## Practical Tips

- **Challenge the claimed emergency.** Ask: was there really an emergency, or did officers have time to get a warrant?
- **Check the timeline.** If officers had been investigating for hours or days before acting, it undermines the claim of a sudden emergency.
- **Look for police-created exigency.** If officers provoked the emergency (e.g., loudly announcing themselves at a drug suspect's door to trigger evidence destruction), argue they manufactured the exigency.
- **The severity of the crime matters.** Courts are less likely to find exigent circumstances for minor offenses. [Welsh v. Wisconsin](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111136/welsh-v-wisconsin/).

## Key Takeaway

Exigent circumstances allow warrantless police action only in genuine emergencies. The government must prove the emergency was real, and officers cannot create the emergency themselves.
