## What It Is

A scheduling order (Federal Rule 16(b)) is the court's roadmap for your case. Issued early in the litigation, it sets deadlines for:

- **Discovery cutoff** — The last day to conduct discovery
- **Disclosure of expert witnesses** — If you're using experts
- **Dispositive motion deadline** — When summary judgment and other motions must be filed
- **Pretrial conference date**
- **Trial date** (sometimes set later)

## Why It Matters

These deadlines are **hard deadlines**. Missing them can be fatal:

- Discovery not completed by the cutoff? Too late.
- Summary judgment motion not filed by the deadline? Waived.
- Expert not disclosed on time? Excluded.

To modify a scheduling order, you need to show "good cause" under Rule 16(b)(4) — which requires showing diligence, not just forgetfulness.

## Pro Se Concerns

- **Calendar everything immediately** — Put each deadline in your calendar with reminders
- **Work backward from deadlines** — If discovery closes in 6 months, you need to serve discovery requests early enough to get responses, file motions to compel if needed, and take depositions
- **Don't agree to dates you can't meet** — Speak up at the scheduling conference if the proposed timeline is too aggressive
- **Request extensions early** — If you need more time, file a motion well before the deadline, not after

## Key Rules

- **Rule 16(b)** — Scheduling orders
- **Rule 16(b)(4)** — "Good cause" standard for modification
