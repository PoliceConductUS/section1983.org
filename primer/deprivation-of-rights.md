## What It Is

"Deprivation of rights" is one of the two essential elements of every [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) claim. The statute allows you to sue any person who, acting under [color of law](/primer/color-of-law), subjects you to a **deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws** of the United States.

In plain language: something the government did to you must have actually violated a specific constitutional or federal right. Feeling mistreated isn't enough — you have to identify **which right** was violated and **how**.

## The Two Elements of § 1983

Every § 1983 claim requires:

1. The defendant acted **under color of state law** (they used government authority)
2. The defendant **deprived you** of a right secured by the Constitution or federal law

This entry focuses on element #2 — the deprivation itself.

## Which Rights Count?

The most common constitutional rights at issue in § 1983 cases include:

- **[Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment)** — Protection against unreasonable searches, seizures, [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force), and [false arrest](/primer/false-arrest)
- **[First Amendment](/primer/first-amendment-retaliation)** — Free speech, right to record police, freedom of religion, right to petition
- **[Fourteenth Amendment](/primer/fourteenth-amendment)** — Due process (both procedural and [substantive](/primer/substantive-due-process)) and equal protection
- **[Eighth Amendment](/primer/eighth-amendment)** — Protection against cruel and unusual punishment (for convicted prisoners)

You can also bring § 1983 claims for violations of certain **federal statutes**, not just constitutional provisions — though the statute must create individually enforceable rights.

## You Need a Real Violation

Not every bad experience with the police or government amounts to a constitutional violation. Courts will dismiss claims where:

- **No constitutional right applies** — Rudeness, verbal abuse, or unprofessionalism, standing alone, typically don't violate the Constitution
- **The right wasn't clearly established** — Even if the conduct was wrong, [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) may shield the officer if the legal standard wasn't clear at the time
- **The conduct was reasonable** — Many constitutional standards (like the [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment)) balance government interests against individual rights. If the government's conduct was reasonable, there's no deprivation.

## How to Plead It

In your complaint, be specific:

1. **Identify the right** — "Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force"
2. **Describe the conduct** — "Officer Doe struck plaintiff repeatedly with a baton while plaintiff was handcuffed and compliant"
3. **Connect them** — Explain how the conduct violated the specific right

Use the [plausibility pleading](/primer/plausibility-pleading) standard — your facts must make the violation plausible, not just possible.

## Key Cases

- [Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167 (1961)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/106290/monroe-v-pape/) — Established that § 1983 provides a federal remedy for constitutional violations by state actors
- [Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137 (1979)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110112/baker-v-mccollan/) — § 1983 is not a general tort statute; you must show an actual constitutional deprivation
- [Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327 (1986)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111601/daniels-v-williams/) — Mere negligence does not constitute a "deprivation" under § 1983
