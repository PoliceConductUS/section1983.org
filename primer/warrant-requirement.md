## What It Is

The [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment) protects you from **unreasonable searches and seizures**. The core rule is simple: police generally need a **warrant** — a court order based on [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause) — before they can search your home, your belongings, or seize your property.

As the Supreme Court stated in [Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347 (1967)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107564/katz-v-united-states/), "searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment — subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions."

## What a Valid Warrant Requires

A valid warrant must have:

1. **Probable cause** — Facts showing it is more likely than not that evidence of a crime will be found in the place to be searched.
2. **Particularity** — The warrant must specifically describe the place to be searched and the items to be seized. No "general warrants" allowed.
3. **Judicial approval** — A neutral judge or magistrate must review and sign the warrant. Police cannot issue warrants to themselves.
4. **Oath or affirmation** — The officer seeking the warrant must swear to the facts under penalty of perjury.

## The Home Gets the Strongest Protection

The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that the home is entitled to the **highest Fourth Amendment protection**. [Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573 (1980)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110261/payton-v-new-york/) held that police need an arrest warrant to enter a home to arrest someone, absent [exigent circumstances](/primer/exigent-circumstances).

In the digital age, [Riley v. California, 573 U.S. 373 (2014)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2713657/riley-v-california/) extended warrant protection to **cell phones**, and [Carpenter v. United States, 585 U.S. 296 (2018)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4509577/carpenter-v-united-states/) required warrants for historical cell-site location data.

## Exceptions to the Warrant Requirement

The warrant requirement has well-established exceptions, including:

- **[Exigent circumstances](/primer/exigent-circumstances)** — emergencies that make getting a warrant impractical
- **[Consent](/primer/consent-search)** — you voluntarily agree to the search
- **Search incident to arrest** — officers can search you and the area within your reach when making a lawful arrest
- **Plain view** — officers can seize evidence in plain sight if they are lawfully in a position to see it
- **Automobile exception** — vehicles can be searched with probable cause but without a warrant, due to their mobility
- **Terry stops** — brief investigative stops and pat-downs based on reasonable suspicion

## Practical Tips

- **If police searched without a warrant**, determine which exception (if any) they relied on. If no exception applies, the search was likely unconstitutional.
- **Document everything.** Write down what happened, what the officers said, and whether they showed you a warrant.
- **A warrant must be specific.** If police searched areas or seized items not listed in the warrant, the search may have exceeded its scope.
- **You can refuse consent.** Politely but clearly say "I do not consent to a search." See [consent search](/primer/consent-search).

## Key Takeaway

Police generally need a warrant to search you or your property. When they search without one, the burden falls on the government to prove an exception applies.
