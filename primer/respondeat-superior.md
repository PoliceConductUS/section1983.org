## What It Is

Respondeat superior ("let the master answer") is a tort doctrine that holds employers liable for the wrongful acts of employees committed within the scope of employment. If a delivery driver runs a red light and hits you, the employer is liable.

## Why It Doesn't Apply to § 1983

In [Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109881/monell-v-department-of-social-services/), the Supreme Court held that municipalities can be sued under § 1983 — but **not** on a respondeat superior theory. A city is not liable simply because it employs an officer who violated your rights.

Instead, you must show the violation resulted from a municipal [policy, custom, or decision by a final policymaker](/primer/monell-liability).

## Why This Matters

In any other area of law, if a police officer assaults you on the job, the city is automatically liable. In § 1983? You have to prove the city had a policy or custom that caused the violation.

This creates a massive gap. An officer who acts on their own — even repeatedly, even egregiously — doesn't generate municipal liability unless you can connect the behavior to a policy, custom, or training failure.

The practical effect: cities shield themselves by saying "that was a rogue officer, not our policy." Even when the pattern of "rogue" officers suggests a systemic problem.

## The Historical Weakness of _Monell_'s Rejection

_Monell_'s rejection of respondeat superior isn't as settled as it appears. The Court based it on the Forty-Second Congress's rejection of the "Sherman Amendment" to the Ku Klux Act — a proposal to make cities liable for Klan violence within their borders. But legal historians have shown this was a misreading.

The Sherman Amendment was rejected because it imposed liability on cities for **failing to prevent third-party violence** — even with no notice and no ability to stop it. That's a nonfeasance problem. Respondeat superior covers something fundamentally different: liability for **your own employee's malfeasance** while acting within the scope of employment. The congressional objections to the Sherman Amendment were, as Professor Achtenberg documents, "utterly inapplicable" to respondeat superior. _See_ David Achtenberg, _Taking History Seriously: Municipal Liability Under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Debate over Respondeat Superior_, 73 Fordham L. Rev. 2183 (2005).

### The anomaly

The result is striking:

- **In every state**, cities are liable under respondeat superior for ordinary torts — car accidents, slip-and-falls, medical malpractice by city employees
- **Under federal § 1983**, cities are exempt from respondeat superior for _constitutional violations_ — the most serious wrongs their employees can commit
- The § 1983 standard is even more demanding than liability for **independent contractors** in ordinary tort law

Four Supreme Court Justices (Breyer, Stevens, Ginsburg, Souter) have called for reexamining _Monell_'s respondeat superior bar. The doctrine has been called "hanging by a thread."

### What this means for you

As a pro se plaintiff, you must work within _Monell_ as it stands — proving policy, custom, or failure to train. But understanding _why_ the doctrine is the way it is helps you see the workaround: **custom and pattern evidence** is functionally the closest available substitute for respondeat superior. If you can show repeated similar violations the city knew about and tolerated, you're building the municipal liability case _Monell_ requires.
