## What It Is

Respondeat superior ("let the master answer") is a tort doctrine that holds employers liable for the wrongful acts of employees committed within the scope of employment. If a delivery driver runs a red light and hits you, the employer is liable.

## Why It Doesn't Apply to § 1983

In [Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109881/monell-v-department-of-social-services/), the Supreme Court held that municipalities can be sued under § 1983 — but **not** on a respondeat superior theory. A city is not liable simply because it employs an officer who violated your rights.

Instead, you must show the violation resulted from a municipal [policy, custom, or decision by a final policymaker](/primer/monell-liability).

## Why This Matters

In any other area of law, if a police officer assaults you on the job, the city is automatically liable. In § 1983? You have to prove the city had a policy or custom that caused the violation.

This creates a massive gap. An officer who acts on their own — even repeatedly, even egregiously — doesn't generate municipal liability unless you can connect the behavior to a policy, custom, or training failure.

The practical effect: cities shield themselves by saying "that was a rogue officer, not our policy." Even when the pattern of "rogue" officers suggests a systemic problem.

## Key Cases

- [Monell v. Dep't of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109881/monell-v-department-of-social-services/) — No respondeat superior in § 1983
- [Board of County Commissioners v. Brown, 520 U.S. 397 (1997)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118184/board-of-county-commrs-of-bryan-cty-v-brown/) — Single hiring decision can create Monell liability only if the need to act was "plainly obvious"
