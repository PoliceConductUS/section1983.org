## What It Is

In forma pauperis (IFP) literally means "in the manner of a pauper." Under 28 U.S.C. § 1915, a person who cannot afford to pay the filing fee ($405 in federal district court as of 2024) can apply to proceed without prepayment.

## How to Apply

File a **motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis** along with your complaint. You'll need to submit a financial affidavit disclosing:

- Your income (employment, benefits, any source)
- Your assets (bank accounts, property, vehicles)
- Your monthly expenses
- Your debts

The court reviews the affidavit and decides whether you qualify. There's no hard income cutoff — the test is whether paying the fee would cause undue hardship.

## What IFP Gets You

- **No filing fee** (or reduced fee)
- **No service costs** — the U.S. Marshals will serve your complaint on the defendants for free
- **Appointed counsel** — the court _can_ request an attorney to represent you, but this is discretionary and uncommon in § 1983 cases

## What IFP Triggers

IFP status triggers **judicial screening** under 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2). The court must dismiss the case if it:

- Is frivolous or malicious
- Fails to state a claim
- Seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune

This screening happens _before_ the defendant is even served. Your complaint has to survive the judge's initial review, or it dies immediately.

## The Practical Reality

IFP screening is a double-edged sword. On one hand, free filing is essential for pro se litigants who can't afford $405. On the other hand, the screening requirement means a judge reviews your complaint with a critical eye before the case even starts — and many pro se complaints get dismissed at screening for failure to state a claim.

Write a strong complaint. The screening judge is your first audience.
