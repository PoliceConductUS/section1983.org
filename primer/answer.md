## What It Is

An answer is the defendant's formal written response to your complaint. Under Federal Rule 8, the answer must respond to each allegation by:

- **Admitting** it
- **Denying** it
- **Stating insufficient knowledge** to admit or deny (which functions as a denial)

The answer must also assert any **affirmative defenses** — legal reasons the defendant shouldn't be liable even if your allegations are true. In § 1983 cases, the most common affirmative defense is [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity).

## Timing

- **21 days** after service of the complaint (or 60 days if the defendant waived formal service)
- If the defendant filed a [motion to dismiss](/primer/motion-to-dismiss) and it was denied, **14 days** after the court's order

## What to Look For

### Admissions

Anything the defendant admits is **established** — you don't need to prove it at trial. Read the answer carefully and note each admission.

### Non-Denial Denials

Government lawyers are masters of non-answers:

- "Defendant lacks sufficient knowledge to admit or deny" — about events the officer personally participated in. That's suspicious.
- "The document speaks for itself" — a dodge, not an answer.
- "Denied as stated" — vague and potentially improper.

If the answer contains improper denials, you can move to strike under Rule 12(f) or raise it at trial.

### Affirmative Defenses

The answer will list affirmative defenses. Common ones in § 1983:

- Qualified immunity
- Failure to state a claim
- Statute of limitations
- Failure to exhaust (for prisoner cases)
- Good faith
- Comparative/contributory fault

These tell you what the defendant plans to argue. Prepare accordingly.

## Counterclaims

The defendant can assert counterclaims against you in the answer. This is rare in § 1983 cases but not unheard of — cities occasionally countersue for property damage or other costs.

## Key Rules

- **Rule 8(b)** — Defenses; admissions and denials
- **Rule 8(c)** — Affirmative defenses
- **Rule 12(a)** — Time to answer
