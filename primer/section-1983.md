## What It Is

42 U.S.C. § 1983 is a federal statute enacted in 1871 as part of the Ku Klux Klan Act. It creates a **cause of action** — a right to sue — against any person who, acting under color of state law, deprives you of rights secured by the Constitution or federal law.

The full text:

> Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress...

## What It Does

§ 1983 doesn't create any constitutional rights. It provides the **mechanism to enforce them**. Think of it as the vehicle, not the road.

To state a § 1983 claim, you must show:

1. **A person** acting **under color of state law**
2. **Deprived you** of a right secured by the Constitution or federal law

That's it. Two elements. Everything else — qualified immunity, Monell, Iqbal pleading standards — is judge-made doctrine layered on top.

## Why It Matters for Pro Se Litigants

§ 1983 is the only realistic path for most people to hold government officials accountable for constitutional violations. There's no federal agency that will sue on your behalf for a Fourth Amendment violation by local police. It's you or nobody.

But the statute as written and the statute as applied are two different things. Courts have added barriers that Congress did not enact:

- **[Qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity)** shields officials unless your exact right was "clearly established"
- **[Monell](/primer/monell-liability)** requires showing a municipal "policy or custom" to sue a city
- **[Iqbal/Twombly](/primer/plausibility-pleading)** demands "plausible" allegations at the pleading stage — before you get any discovery

## Key Cases

- [Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167 (1961)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/106272/monroe-v-pape/) — Established that § 1983 applies to state officials acting under color of law, even when violating state law
- [Monell v. Department of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/109881/monell-v-department-of-social-services/) — Extended § 1983 liability to municipalities, but only for "policies or customs"
- [Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 (1982)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110837/harlow-v-fitzgerald/) — Created the modern qualified immunity standard
