## What It Is

Interrogatories are written questions served on the opposing party that must be answered **under oath** within 30 days (federal). Under Federal Rule 33, each party is limited to **25 interrogatories** (including subparts) unless the court orders otherwise.

## What to Ask

In a § 1983 case against police officers, strong interrogatories include:

- **Identify all witnesses** to the incident
- **Describe the training** received on use of force, arrest procedures, or the specific conduct at issue
- **Identify all prior complaints** or disciplinary actions against the defendant officer
- **State the factual basis** for each affirmative defense (especially [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity))
- **Identify all documents** related to the incident (reports, recordings, communications)
- **Describe the officer's version** of events in detail

## The Problem with Interrogatories

Government defendants are notorious for giving **non-answers**:

- "Defendant objects as overly broad and unduly burdensome" (on a straightforward question)
- "Defendant refers plaintiff to the police report" (instead of actually answering)
- "Defendant has no information responsive to this interrogatory" (when they clearly do)

Your remedy: [motion to compel](/primer/motion-to-compel). Document the deficient response, meet and confer, then ask the court to order a real answer.

## Tips

- **Don't waste questions on things you can get from documents** — Use requests for production instead
- **Ask "contention interrogatories"** — "State all facts supporting your defense of qualified immunity" forces them to commit to a position
- **Use subparts carefully** — Courts count related subparts as one question, but truly independent subparts count separately
- **Save some for after depositions** — You can serve additional interrogatories by stipulation or court order if needed

## Key Rules

- **Rule 33** — Interrogatories to parties (25 limit, 30-day response)
- **Rule 37(a)** — Motion to compel answers
