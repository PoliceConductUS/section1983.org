## What It Is

If you file your § 1983 case in **state court**, the defendant can often "remove" the case to **federal court**. Removal is governed by 28 U.S.C. § 1441. Because § 1983 claims arise under federal law, they almost always qualify for removal.

## How It Works

1. **The defendant files a notice of removal** in the federal district court covering the state court location, along with copies of all state court filings.
2. **All defendants must consent** to removal (with limited exceptions). [28 U.S.C. § 1446(b)(2)(A)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1446).
3. **The deadline is 30 days** from when the defendant receives the initial pleading (your complaint) or a later document that first makes the case removable.
4. Once the notice is filed, the **state court loses jurisdiction** and the case proceeds in federal court.

## Why Defendants Remove

Defendants — especially government entities — often prefer federal court because:

- Federal judges may be seen as more experienced with constitutional issues
- Federal procedural rules may favor defendants
- [Qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) motions may be resolved more efficiently

## Can You Stop It?

If you believe removal was improper, you can file a **motion to [remand](/primer/remand)** under 28 U.S.C. § 1447. Common grounds include:

- The case was removed after the 30-day deadline
- Not all defendants consented
- There is no federal jurisdiction (rare for § 1983 claims since they arise under federal law)

The Supreme Court addressed removal jurisdiction in [Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386 (1987)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/111914/caterpillar-inc-v-williams/).

## Filing in Federal Court to Avoid Removal

Many § 1983 plaintiffs file directly in federal court in the first place. Since federal courts have original jurisdiction over federal civil rights claims under [28 U.S.C. § 1331](/primer/federal-jurisdiction), this avoids the removal process entirely.

## Practical Tips

- **If you filed in state court**, expect removal. It happens in most § 1983 cases.
- **Watch the calendar.** If the defendant removes late (after 30 days), you may be able to get the case [remanded](/primer/remand).
- **Filing in federal court from the start** is simpler for most § 1983 claims and avoids the disruption of removal.
- **[Venue](/primer/venue) after removal** is the federal district embracing the state court where the case was filed.

## Key Takeaway

Removal lets defendants move your state-court § 1983 case to federal court. If you want to control where your case is heard, consider filing in federal court from the beginning.
