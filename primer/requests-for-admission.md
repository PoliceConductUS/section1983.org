## What It Is

Requests for admission (RFAs) under Federal Rule 36 ask the opposing party to **admit or deny** specific statements of fact or the application of law to fact. Unlike interrogatories, which ask questions, RFAs make assertions that the other side must respond to.

## The Nuclear Option

Here's the power move: if a party **fails to respond** within 30 days, each request is **deemed admitted**. Automatically. No court order needed.

This has ended cases. If the defendant doesn't respond and you've crafted your RFAs well — "Admit that Officer Smith did not have probable cause to arrest plaintiff" — you may be able to win on [summary judgment](/primer/summary-judgment) based on deemed admissions alone.

## What to Request

Strong RFAs in § 1983 cases:

- **"Admit that no warrant was issued for plaintiff's arrest"**
- **"Admit that defendant Officer Smith's body camera was activated during the incident"**
- **"Admit that plaintiff was not armed at the time of the arrest"**
- **"Admit that the document attached as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of [police report]"** — Authenticating documents via RFA saves time at trial
- **"Admit that defendant City had no written policy on [specific topic] as of [date]"**

## How Defendants Respond

Defendants can:

1. **Admit** — The fact is established. No further proof needed.
2. **Deny** — They dispute it. You'll need to prove it.
3. **Object** — They claim the request is improper (overly broad, vague, etc.)
4. **Qualify** — "Admit in part, deny in part" with explanation.

If their denial is unreasonable and you later prove the fact at trial, you can recover the **costs of proving it** under Rule 37(c)(2).

## Strategic Use

- **Use early** to establish undisputed facts and narrow the issues for trial
- **Use before summary judgment** to lock in admissions that support your motion
- **Authenticate documents** — Much easier than calling a records custodian at trial
- **No numerical limit** in federal court (unlike interrogatories), but courts can limit unreasonable numbers

## Key Rules

- **Rule 36** — Requests for admission
- **Rule 37(c)(2)** — Costs of proving matters that should have been admitted
