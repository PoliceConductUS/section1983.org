## What It Is

The Ex parte Young doctrine is a critical workaround to [sovereign immunity](/primer/sovereign-immunity). Under [Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/96846/ex-parte-young/), the Supreme Court held that when a state official violates the Constitution, they are **"stripped" of their official character** and can be sued in federal court for prospective (forward-looking) injunctive relief.

The legal fiction: you are not suing the state — you are suing an individual who happens to be a state officer and is acting unconstitutionally.

## How It Works

To use Ex parte Young, your lawsuit must:

1. **Name a state official** (not the state itself) as the defendant
2. **Sue them in their [official capacity](/primer/official-capacity)**
3. **Seek prospective relief** — an injunction ordering the official to stop the ongoing constitutional violation or comply with the law going forward
4. **Allege an ongoing violation of federal law**

You **cannot** use Ex parte Young to get **money damages** for past harm. That is still blocked by the [Eleventh Amendment](/primer/eleventh-amendment). The doctrine only opens the door to forward-looking relief.

## Key Cases

- [Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/96846/ex-parte-young/) — The foundational case establishing the doctrine.
- [Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/108912/edelman-v-jordan/) — Clarified that Ex parte Young does not permit retroactive monetary relief disguised as equitable relief.
- [Verizon Maryland Inc. v. Public Service Commission, 535 U.S. 635 (2002)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118512/verizon-maryland-inc-v-public-serv-commn-of-md/) — Applied a straightforward inquiry: does the complaint allege an ongoing violation of federal law and seek prospective relief?

## When It Applies in § 1983 Cases

Ex parte Young is most useful when:

- A **state agency** has an unconstitutional policy (e.g., a state prison system with cruel conditions) and you want a court order forcing change
- You need an **injunction** against a state official to stop ongoing constitutional violations
- You cannot get damages from the state, but you need the harmful conduct to **stop**

## Practical Tips

- **Name the right official.** Sue the specific state official responsible for enforcing the unconstitutional policy — not the state, not the agency.
- **Request prospective relief only.** Ask the court to order the official to stop the violation going forward. Do not frame your request as compensation for past harm.
- **Combine with personal-capacity claims.** You can sue the same official in their personal capacity for damages _and_ in their official capacity for injunctive relief under Ex parte Young.
- **This only applies to state officials.** For cities and counties, you sue the municipality directly under [Monell](/primer/monell-liability).

## Key Takeaway

Ex parte Young lets you get a federal court order stopping a state official from violating your constitutional rights — even though you can't sue the state itself for damages.
