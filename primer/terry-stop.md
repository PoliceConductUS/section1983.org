## What It Is

A Terry stop is a brief investigative detention authorized by [Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/). It allows officers to briefly stop a person based on [reasonable suspicion](/primer/reasonable-suspicion) — a standard lower than [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause).

If the officer also reasonably believes the person is armed and dangerous, they can conduct a limited pat-down frisk of outer clothing for weapons.

## The Limits

A Terry stop must be:

- **Brief** — Minutes, not hours
- **Limited in scope** — The investigation must be related to the basis for the stop
- **Minimally intrusive** — Handcuffs, drawing weapons, or placing someone in a squad car may convert it to a de facto arrest

A frisk is limited to:

- **Outer clothing** — No reaching into pockets unless the officer feels something that's immediately identifiable as a weapon
- **Weapons only** — The purpose is officer safety, not evidence gathering (though the "plain feel" doctrine allows seizure of contraband felt during a lawful frisk)

## When a Stop Becomes an Arrest

If police exceed the bounds of a Terry stop — detaining you too long, moving you to a new location, using excessive force, or searching beyond a pat-down — it becomes a de facto arrest requiring probable cause. If they don't have probable cause at that point, the arrest is unlawful.

[Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491 (1983)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110895/florida-v-royer/) — Moving a suspect from a public concourse to a small room exceeded the bounds of a Terry stop.

- [Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491 (1983)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110895/florida-v-royer/) — Stop exceeded Terry bounds
- [Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366 (1993)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112839/minnesota-v-dickerson/) — "Plain feel" doctrine during lawful frisk
- [Rodriguez v. United States, 575 U.S. 348 (2015)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2780015/rodriguez-v-united-states/) — Traffic stop can't be extended beyond its purpose without additional reasonable suspicion
