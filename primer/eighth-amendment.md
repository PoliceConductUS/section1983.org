## What It Is

The Eighth Amendment prohibits "cruel and unusual punishments." In the § 1983 context, it protects **convicted prisoners** from:

- Excessive force by corrections officers
- Deliberate indifference to serious medical needs
- Unconstitutional conditions of confinement
- Failure to protect from violence by other inmates

Eighth Amendment claims require a higher [mental state](/primer/state-of-mind) than Fourth Amendment claims. For excessive force, you must show the officer acted **maliciously and sadistically** to cause harm, not just that the force was unreasonable. For conditions of confinement and medical care, the standard is **[deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference)** — the defendant knew of a serious risk and consciously ignored it.

## Who It Covers (and Doesn't)

- **Convicted prisoners** → Eighth Amendment
- **Pretrial detainees** → [Fourteenth Amendment](/primer/fourteenth-amendment) (due process)
- **People being arrested** → [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment)

The distinction matters because the standards are different. The Eighth Amendment requires a **subjective** showing — the official must have actually known of and disregarded a substantial risk. After [Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U.S. 389 (2015)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2807350/kingsley-v-hendrickson/), the Fourteenth Amendment standard for pretrial detainees may be **objective** (at least for force claims).

## Conditions of Confinement

To establish an Eighth Amendment conditions claim:

1. **Objective component**: The deprivation must be "sufficiently serious" — denying the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities (food, warmth, exercise, medical care, safety)
2. **Subjective component**: The official must have been [deliberately indifferent](/primer/deliberate-indifference) — actually aware of a substantial risk of serious harm and failing to act

## Excessive Force (Post-Conviction)

For convicted prisoners, the force standard is whether the officer applied force "maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm." [Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1 (1992)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/112736/hudson-v-mcmillian/). This is more protective than the Fourth Amendment's "objective reasonableness" standard.
