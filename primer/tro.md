## What It Is

A temporary restraining order (TRO) is an **emergency, short-term court order** that preserves the status quo until the court can hold a full hearing. In § 1983 cases, you might seek a TRO to stop ongoing unconstitutional conduct — like continued harassment, an imminent unlawful eviction, or destruction of evidence.

A TRO is the fastest form of [injunctive relief](/primer/injunctive-relief). Unlike a [preliminary injunction](/primer/preliminary-injunction), a TRO can sometimes be granted **without the other side being present** (called "ex parte"), though courts strongly prefer giving notice.

## How Long Does It Last?

Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b), a TRO lasts **no more than 14 days**, though the court can extend it for another 14 days for good cause. After that, it must either convert into a preliminary injunction (after a hearing with both sides) or expire.

## What You Must Show

To get a TRO, you generally must demonstrate the same four factors as a preliminary injunction:

1. **Likelihood of success on the merits** — You'll probably win your § 1983 claim
2. **[Irreparable harm](/primer/irreparable-harm)** — You'll suffer harm that money can't fix if the court doesn't act now
3. **Balance of equities** — The harm to you outweighs the burden on the defendant
4. **Public interest** — The order serves the public interest

The emphasis in a TRO is on **urgency**. You need to convince the court that waiting even a few weeks for a preliminary injunction hearing would cause serious, irreparable damage.

## How to Request One

1. **File a complaint** — You need an active case (your § 1983 lawsuit)
2. **File a motion for TRO** — Explain the emergency and why you can't wait
3. **Submit a declaration or affidavit** — Provide sworn facts supporting your claims
4. **Propose an order** — Draft the specific order you want the court to issue
5. **Give notice** — You must attempt to notify the other side. Ex parte TROs (no notice) require showing why notice is impossible or would defeat the purpose.

## Common § 1983 Scenarios

- **Police are threatening imminent retaliation** for exercising First Amendment rights
- **Jail or prison conditions** pose an immediate danger to your health or life
- **Evidence is being destroyed** that you need for your case
- **An unconstitutional policy is about to be enforced** against you

## Practical Tips

- Courts grant TROs **rarely** — you need a genuine emergency
- Be as specific as possible about what you want the court to order
- A TRO is temporary — start preparing for your preliminary injunction hearing immediately
- If you're [pro se](/primer/pro-se), the court may cut you some slack on procedure, but you still need to meet the legal standard
