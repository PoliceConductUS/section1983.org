## What It Is

The favorable termination rule means that for certain § 1983 claims, you **cannot sue until the related criminal case ends in your favor**. This rule comes from the Supreme Court's decision in [Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/117817/heck-v-humphrey/), sometimes called the [Heck doctrine](/primer/heck-doctrine).

The logic: if winning your § 1983 case would necessarily **imply that your criminal conviction was invalid**, you must first get that conviction overturned before suing.

## How It Works

Ask yourself: **Would success in my § 1983 case contradict my criminal conviction or sentence?**

- **If yes** — you must first get the conviction reversed, expunged, or otherwise invalidated before your § 1983 claim can proceed.
- **If no** — you can proceed with the § 1983 case regardless of the criminal case outcome.

For example, if you were convicted of resisting arrest and then sued the officer for excessive force _during that arrest_, some courts will ask whether finding excessive force would necessarily undermine the resisting conviction. If so, Heck bars the claim until the conviction is overturned.

## Fourth Amendment Claims After Thompson

The Supreme Court clarified in [Thompson v. Clark, 596 U.S. 36 (2022)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4536198/thompson-v-clark/) that a Fourth Amendment [malicious prosecution](/primer/malicious-prosecution) claim requires favorable termination, but the termination need not affirmatively indicate innocence. A dismissal of charges is sufficient — you don't need an acquittal.

## What Counts as Favorable Termination?

- **Acquittal** at trial ✅
- **Dismissal** of all charges ✅
- **Nolle prosequi** (prosecutor drops the case) ✅ (in most circuits)
- **Conviction reversed** on appeal ✅
- **Guilty plea** to the charge ❌ (not favorable)
- **Charges still pending** ❌ (not yet terminated)

## Claims Affected

- **[Malicious prosecution](/primer/malicious-prosecution)** — always requires favorable termination
- **[False arrest](/primer/false-arrest)** — generally does NOT require favorable termination (the arrest itself is the injury)
- **Excessive force** — usually does NOT require favorable termination unless the force claim directly contradicts a conviction

## Practical Tips

- **Check your criminal case status.** If charges are still pending or you were convicted, some § 1983 claims may be premature.
- **Don't wait too long.** Once you get a favorable termination, the [statute of limitations](/primer/statute-of-limitations) may start running — see [accrual](/primer/accrual).
- **Not all claims are Heck-barred.** Many excessive force and illegal search claims can proceed even with a conviction.

## Key Takeaway

If your § 1983 claim would undermine a criminal conviction, you must get that conviction overturned first. Otherwise, the claim is barred under Heck.
