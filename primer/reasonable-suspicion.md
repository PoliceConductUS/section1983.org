## What It Is

Reasonable suspicion is the evidentiary standard required for a **Terry stop** — a brief, investigative detention. It's lower than [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause) but higher than a mere hunch.

An officer has reasonable suspicion when they can point to "specific and articulable facts" that, combined with rational inferences, suggest criminal activity is afoot. [Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/).

## What It Allows

- **Brief detention**: Police can stop you and ask questions
- **Pat-down frisk**: If the officer also has reasonable suspicion that you're armed and dangerous, they can conduct a limited pat-down of your outer clothing for weapons
- **Traffic stops**: Reasonable suspicion of a traffic violation justifies a stop

## What It Doesn't Allow

- **Arrest** — requires probable cause
- **Full search** — requires probable cause, a warrant, or a warrant exception
- **Extended detention** — the stop must be brief and limited in scope; prolonging it beyond what's reasonable converts it to a de facto arrest

## The Line Between Stop and Arrest

A Terry stop that lasts too long, involves too much force, or moves you to a different location starts looking like an arrest — which requires probable cause. If police detained you for 45 minutes in handcuffs in the back of a squad car based on a "suspicious person" call, that's probably an arrest, not a stop.

## Key Cases

- [Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/) — Created the reasonable suspicion standard
- [Illinois v. Wardlow, 528 U.S. 119 (2000)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/118363/illinois-v-wardlow/) — Flight from police in a high-crime area can contribute to reasonable suspicion
- [Navarette v. California, 572 U.S. 393 (2014)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2616206/navarette-v-california/) — Anonymous tip can establish reasonable suspicion under some circumstances
- [Rodriguez v. United States, 575 U.S. 348 (2015)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2780015/rodriguez-v-united-states/) — Traffic stop cannot be extended beyond its purpose without reasonable suspicion of additional criminal activity
