## What It Is

Pretrial detention is being held in custody between arrest and trial (or other resolution of criminal charges). Because pretrial detainees have not been convicted, their rights are protected by the **[Fourteenth Amendment](/primer/fourteenth-amendment)** (due process), not the [Eighth Amendment](/primer/eighth-amendment) (which applies only to convicted prisoners).

## Why the Distinction Matters

The Fourteenth Amendment standard for pretrial detainees may be **more protective** than the Eighth Amendment standard for convicted prisoners:

- After [Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U.S. 389 (2015)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2807350/kingsley-v-hendrickson/), excessive force claims by pretrial detainees use an **objective** standard — whether force was objectively unreasonable — rather than the subjective "maliciously and sadistically" standard for convicted prisoners
- Several circuits have extended Kingsley's objective standard to conditions-of-confinement claims, though this is an active circuit split

## Common Pretrial Detention Claims

- **Excessive force** — Officers or guards using unreasonable force
- **Conditions of confinement** — Overcrowding, unsanitary conditions, denial of basic necessities
- **Medical care** — [Deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference) to serious medical or mental health needs
- **Failure to protect** — Failure to protect from violence by other inmates
- **Strip searches** — Unconstitutional searches of pretrial detainees charged with minor offenses (though [Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, 566 U.S. 318 (2012)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/616104/florence-v-board-of-chosen-freeholders-of-county-of-burlington/) significantly weakened this claim)

## The Bell v. Wolfish Framework

[Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110087/bell-v-wolfish/) established that pretrial detainees cannot be **punished** — any restriction must serve a legitimate governmental purpose (security, order, efficient operation). If a condition or restriction is imposed for the purpose of punishment, it violates due process. If it's not reasonably related to a legitimate purpose, a court may infer punishment.

## Key Cases

- [Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/110087/bell-v-wolfish/) — No punishment of pretrial detainees
- [Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U.S. 389 (2015)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2807350/kingsley-v-hendrickson/) — Objective standard for pretrial detainee force claims
- [Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, 566 U.S. 318 (2012)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/616104/florence-v-board-of-chosen-freeholders-of-county-of-burlington/) — Strip searches of minor offenders upheld
