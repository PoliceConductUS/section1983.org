## What It Is

A preliminary injunction (PI) and temporary restraining order (TRO) are emergency court orders that maintain the status quo while the case is litigated. A TRO can be obtained _ex parte_ (without the other side present) and lasts up to 14 days. A PI requires notice and a hearing and lasts until trial.

## The Four-Factor Test

To get a PI under [Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 555 U.S. 7 (2008)](https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/145908/winter-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/):

1. **Likelihood of success on the merits** — You're likely to win your § 1983 claim
2. **Irreparable harm** — Without the injunction, you'll suffer harm that can't be fixed with money
3. **Balance of equities** — The harm to you outweighs the burden on the defendant
4. **Public interest** — The injunction serves the public interest

Constitutional violations are often presumed to cause irreparable harm. And the public always has an interest in constitutional policing.

## When to Use It

- **Ongoing harassment** — An officer is continuing to target you
- **Destruction of evidence** — You need a court order to preserve body camera footage
- **Unconstitutional policy** — A department policy is actively violating people's rights
- **Jail conditions** — Pretrial detainees facing immediate health or safety threats
