## What It Is

Under Federal Rule 26(f), the parties must confer — usually by phone or in person — at least 21 days before the scheduling conference with the judge. This is where you and opposing counsel discuss:

- The claims and defenses
- Possibilities for settlement
- A discovery plan (what discovery is needed, deadlines, limits)
- Any issues about preserving evidence
- Whether protective orders are needed

## Why It Matters

The Rule 26(f) conference sets the discovery framework for your entire case. The positions you take here shape the [scheduling order](/primer/scheduling-order) the judge enters. If you don't push for the discovery you need at this stage, you may not get it later.

## Pro Se Tips

- **Prepare your discovery needs in advance** — Know what documents, depositions, and interrogatories you'll need
- **Propose specific deadlines** — Don't leave it to the defense to set the pace
- **Raise preservation issues** — If you're concerned about evidence destruction, raise it here
- **Document the conference** — Send a follow-up email confirming what was discussed and agreed upon
- **Don't agree to short deadlines** — The defense will try to compress the timeline. You need time to conduct discovery, especially without a legal team.

## The Discovery Plan

After the conference, the parties must submit a written discovery plan to the court (usually as a joint report). The plan typically covers:

- Subjects for discovery
- Timeline and cutoff dates
- Limits on interrogatories, depositions, and RFPs
- ESI protocols (format, search terms, custodians)
- Privilege log procedures

## Key Rules

- **Rule 26(f)** — Conference of the parties; planning for discovery
- **Rule 16** — Pretrial conferences; scheduling
- **Rule 26(a)** — Required initial disclosures (due within 14 days after the 26(f) conference)
