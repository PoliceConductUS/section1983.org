## Why preparation comes first

Most pro se § 1983 cases die at the [motion to dismiss](/process/rule-12-motions) stage. The reason is almost always the same: the complaint doesn't contain enough _specific facts_ to satisfy the [plausibility standard](/primer/plausibility-pleading) set by [_Ashcroft v. Iqbal_](/cases/ashcroft-v-iqbal) and [_Bell Atlantic v. Twombly_](/cases/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly).

"Officer Smith used [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force)" is a legal conclusion. A judge will ignore it. "Officer Smith struck Plaintiff in the head with a closed fist three times while Plaintiff was handcuffed and lying face-down" is a factual allegation. The second version survives because it contains _facts_ — specific, verifiable, plausible facts.

Where do those facts come from? You already have some — you were there. But your memory alone isn't enough. You need documents, footage, data, and records that corroborate what happened and reveal what you don't yet know.

**The critical insight**: most of this evidence is available through public records requests _before_ you file suit. Once you file, agencies often become less cooperative, and you'll have to fight for records through formal [discovery](/process/discovery) — a slower, more adversarial process. Get what you can now.

This stage has two parts:

1. **[Gathering your evidence](/process/foia-and-records-requests)** — FOIA requests, body camera footage, statistical data
2. **[Organizing your war room](/process/organizing-your-war-room)** — folder structure, strategy documents, case timeline

## What you're building toward

By the time you finish this preparation stage, you should have:

- [ ] Body camera footage (or a documented refusal to provide it)
- [ ] Incident reports, arrest reports, use-of-force reports
- [ ] Dispatch audio and CAD records
- [ ] Department policies relevant to your claims
- [ ] Complaint history for the officer(s) involved
- [ ] Statistical data comparing your officer(s) to department-wide patterns
- [ ] A chronological timeline with source citations
- [ ] An organized case file you can navigate without searching
- [ ] Strategy documents mapping each claim to its elements and evidence
- [ ] An honest assessment of your case's weaknesses

Not every item will be available in every case. Some agencies will deny requests or drag their feet. That's fine — document the denials. A refusal to produce public records is itself evidence, and it becomes relevant if you later bring [spoliation](/primer/spoliation) claims or argue [deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference) to accountability.

## How long this takes

Plan for **6 months or more** before you're ready to file. That sounds like a long time. It isn't.

You're not just collecting records during this period — you're learning an entirely new field. Constitutional law, civil procedure, [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity), [Monell liability](/primer/monell-liability), the [plausibility pleading](/primer/plausibility-pleading) standard. The more you learn, the more clearly you see your own evidence. Facts that seemed minor when you started — the officer's tone of voice, the sequence of commands, the backup officer who stood and watched — become significant once you understand the legal frameworks they fit into.

A complaint written after two weeks of preparation reads like a victim's account. A complaint written after six months of preparation reads like a lawyer's. The judge can tell the difference, and so can the defense attorneys deciding whether to take your case seriously or steamroll you at the [motion to dismiss](/process/rule-12-motions).

**What changes with more preparation time:**

- You start seeing your evidence the way a judge would — not emotionally, but analytically
- You learn to map every fact to a specific legal element, not just tell a story
- You anticipate the defense's arguments before they make them
- You identify your own weaknesses before opposing counsel exploits them
- You write a complaint that's harder to dismiss, harder to attack, and harder to ignore

Use this time. Every fact you nail down now is a fact the defense can't muddy later. Every document you obtain now is one you won't have to fight for in [discovery](/process/discovery). Every statistical pattern you identify now is one that transforms a conclusory allegation into a plausible claim.

## The [statute of limitations](/primer/statute-of-limitations) clock

While you prepare, the clock is running. § 1983 borrows the state's personal injury statute of limitations — typically 2–3 years from the date of the incident. In Texas, it's 2 years. In New York, it's 3.

Don't let preparation become procrastination. If you're within 8 months of the deadline, consider filing first and preparing in parallel. A thin complaint that preserves your claims is better than a perfect complaint filed one day late.

If you're within 90 days, stop preparing and [file now](/process/filing). You can [amend your complaint](/primer/amended-complaint) later with the additional facts.

## Cost

- FOIA/open records requests: **Free to $0.25/page** (varies by state and agency)
- Certified copies: **$1–5 per document** (if needed for filing)
- Body camera footage: **Free to $25** (some agencies charge for media)
- Your time: **Significant** — plan for 2–4 hours per week during this phase

Before you file, **[stress-test your case](/articles/how-to-stress-test-your-case-before-filing)** — tear apart your own complaint the way the defense will. Every claim that survives your own scrutiny will be stronger when it faces theirs.

## Template: Evidence Preservation Demand Letter

Send this **immediately** — before your FOIA requests, before your complaint, as early as possible. This creates a dated record that the agency was on notice to preserve evidence. If records later disappear, this letter is the foundation of a [spoliation](/primer/spoliation) argument.

**Send by certified mail, return receipt requested.** Keep the receipt.

**Notes:**

- Address it to multiple recipients — chief, city attorney, records custodian. The more people on notice, the harder it is to claim ignorance later.
- Keep a copy of the signed letter, the certified mail receipt, and the return receipt card.
- If you don't receive confirmation within 10 business days, send a follow-up referencing the original demand and noting the lack of response.

## Next steps

Start with **[gathering your evidence](/process/foia-and-records-requests)** — the FOIA requests that will form the backbone of your complaint.
