## What happens at this stage

Instead of answering your complaint, defendants file a [motion to dismiss](/primer/motion-to-dismiss) under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12. This is their first chance to kill your case — and in [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) litigation, they almost always take it.

The most common grounds:

- **Rule 12(b)(6)** — failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted
- **Rule 12(b)(1)** — lack of [federal jurisdiction](/primer/federal-jurisdiction)
- **[Qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity)** — raised within a 12(b)(6) motion, arguing the officer is immune

You will file a response (opposition). They may file a reply. Then the court decides.

## What the court is deciding

At the Rule 12 stage, the court asks one question: **taking all your factual allegations as true, have you stated a plausible claim for relief?**

The court does **not** weigh evidence. There is no evidence yet. The court reads your complaint, accepts the facts as true, and decides whether those facts — if proven — would entitle you to relief.

This is the [_Ashcroft v. Iqbal_](/cases/ashcroft-v-iqbal) / [_Bell Atlantic v. Twombly_](/cases/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly) [plausibility pleading](/primer/plausibility-pleading) standard:

- **Factual allegations** are accepted as true
- **Legal conclusions** ("the defendant violated my rights") are stripped out
- What remains must make the claim **plausible**, not just possible

## Qualified immunity at Rule 12

Defendants will almost certainly raise qualified immunity in their motion to dismiss. At this stage, the QI analysis works like this:

1. **Do the facts alleged, taken as true, show a constitutional violation?**
2. **Was the right clearly established at the time of the conduct?**

Under [_Pearson v. Callahan_](/cases/pearson-v-callahan), the court can address these in either order — or skip the first question entirely and dismiss on "not clearly established" alone.

### What "clearly established" means at Rule 12

The court looks for prior case law — ideally from the Supreme Court or your circuit — that put the unlawfulness "beyond debate." The Supreme Court has said the facts don't need to be _identical_ ([_Hope v. Pelzer_, 536 U.S. 730 (2002)](/cases/hope-v-pelzer)), but in practice, most circuits — particularly the Fifth Circuit — demand a high degree of factual similarity. The more your facts differ from existing precedent, the more likely the officer gets immunity. Defendants will argue that any factual distinction means the right wasn't "clearly established" for your specific situation.

If there's no case on point, the officer gets immunity — even if what they did was objectively unconstitutional. This is the catch-22: rights don't get "clearly established" because courts keep dismissing on QI without deciding the constitutional question.

## Your response

Your opposition brief is critical. This is your first substantive legal argument in the case. Structure it clearly:

1. **Legal standard** — remind the court that Rule 12 requires accepting your facts as true
2. **Element-by-element analysis** — walk through each element of each claim, tying specific complaint paragraphs to each element
3. **Qualified immunity** — address both prongs. Cite the closest binding precedent. Show the officer had fair warning.
4. **Request leave to amend** — if the court finds deficiencies, ask for leave to file an amended complaint rather than dismissal with prejudice

### What to avoid

- **Don't introduce new facts** — your opposition is based on the complaint as filed. If facts are missing from the complaint, you need to amend, not argue facts that aren't pleaded.
- **Don't argue evidence** — there is none yet. This is about what you alleged, not what you can prove.
- **Don't ignore their arguments** — address every ground they raise. Silence = concession.
- **Don't be conclusory** — if your complaint says "the arrest violated the Fourth Amendment," explain _why_ with specific facts.

## What defendants are doing

Defense counsel has three goals:

1. **Get the case dismissed entirely** — the ideal outcome for defendants
2. **Get claims narrowed** — even partial dismissal reduces their exposure
3. **Force you to reveal your theory** — your opposition brief shows them how you'll argue the case, and they'll use it against you in discovery and summary judgment

They know the Iqbal standard well. They will argue:

- Your allegations are "conclusory" (legal conclusions, not facts)
- Alternative explanations exist for the conduct (the Iqbal "more likely explanation" test)
- No clearly established law prohibits the specific conduct alleged
- [Municipal liability](/primer/municipal-liability) fails because you haven't identified a specific policy

## Possible outcomes

- **Motion denied** — your case proceeds. Defendants must answer. This is a major milestone.
- **Motion granted with leave to amend** — the court found deficiencies but gives you a chance to fix them with an [amended complaint](/primer/amended-complaint). Take it seriously. You may only get one shot.
- **Motion granted without leave to amend** — the claim is dismissed. If it's all claims, the case is over (subject to appeal). If it's some claims, the surviving claims proceed.
- **Motion granted in part, denied in part** — some claims survive, others don't. Common in multi-claim § 1983 cases.

## Interlocutory appeal

If the court denies qualified immunity, defendants can file an immediate [interlocutory appeal](/primer/interlocutory-appeal) under the [collateral order doctrine](/primer/collateral-order-doctrine). This freezes your case and sends the QI question to the circuit court. See the [interlocutory appeal](/process/interlocutory-appeal/) page for how this works and how it's abused.

## Timeline

- **Defendant's motion**: filed instead of an answer (within 21 or 60 days of service)
- **Your opposition**: typically 21 days after the motion (check local rules)
- **Their reply**: typically 14 days after your opposition
- **Court decision**: weeks to months depending on the judge's docket
- **Total delay**: 3-6 months from filing to decision, potentially 6-18 more if interlocutory appeal follows

## Common traps

- **Missing the response deadline** — if you don't respond, the court may grant the motion as unopposed
- **Not requesting leave to amend** — if you don't ask, the court may dismiss without giving you a chance to fix the complaint
- **Failing to address QI specifically** — a general "my rights were violated" argument won't survive. Cite specific cases. Show clearly established law.
- **Engaging with defense rhetoric** — defendants will include inflammatory characterizations of your conduct. Don't take the bait. Respond to the legal arguments, not the insults.
