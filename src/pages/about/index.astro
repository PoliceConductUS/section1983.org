    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      When police violate your constitutional rights, federal law gives you the
      right to sue under
      <a href="/about/section-1983">42 U.S.C. § 1983</a>. But most people who
      need this law don't know it exists — and most lawyers won't take the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>section1983.org exists to close that gap.</strong> We explain civil
      rights law in plain language, using real cases and practical guidance, so people
      representing themselves can navigate federal court with their eyes open.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are <strong>completely independent</strong> of police and government. We
      have no law enforcement sponsors, no government funding, and no political agenda.
      Our only commitment is to accurate, accessible legal education.
    </p>
