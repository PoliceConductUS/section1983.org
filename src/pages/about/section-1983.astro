      The History & Purpose of § 1983
    </h1>

    <h2>What § 1983 actually is</h2>
    <p>
      In 1871, six years after the Civil War ended, Congress had a problem.
      Former Confederate soldiers and Klan members held positions throughout
      Southern law enforcement and local government. They were using their
      authority to terrorize Black citizens — murdering, assaulting, and
      intimidating freedmen who tried to vote, hold office, or simply exist as
      equal citizens. Local courts wouldn't stop it. Local prosecutors wouldn't
      charge it. The system was the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Congress passed the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 — also called the Civil
      Rights Act of 1871 — and President Grant signed it into law. Every
      Republican voted yes. Every Democrat voted no. Section 1 of that act is
      what we now call 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The language is straightforward:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation,
      custom, or usage, of any State or Territory … subjects, or causes to be
      subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the
      jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or
      immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the
      party injured …"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      No exceptions. No qualifications. <em>Shall be liable.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the intent: when the state itself is the abuser, federal courts
      step in.
    </p>

    <h2>What happened next</h2>
    <p>
      For almost ninety years, nothing. The statute sat dormant while Jim Crow
      flourished. It wasn't until 1961, in
      <em>Monroe v. Pape</em>, that the Supreme Court revived § 1983 and held
      that citizens could sue state officials in federal court for
      constitutional violations — even if the official's conduct also violated
      state law.
    </p>
    <p>Then the Court started taking it back.</p>
    <p>
      In 1967, in <em>Pierson v. Ray</em>, the Supreme Court invented qualified
      immunity. Not Congress. Not a constitutional amendment. The Court simply
      decided that police officers shouldn't face liability unless they violated
      "clearly established" law. This doctrine appears nowhere in the text of §
      1983. It appears nowhere in the Constitution. Congress never voted on it.
      It is entirely judge-made law — created by the same branch of government
      that § 1983 was designed to hold accountable.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1982, <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald</em> made it worse. The Court removed the
      subjective "good faith" requirement, so it no longer mattered whether an officer
      <em>believed</em> they were violating your rights. The only question became
      whether a prior court case had already established, with specificity, that this
      exact conduct was unconstitutional. No prior case on point? No liability. The
      officer walks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in 2009, <em>Pearson v. Callahan</em> closed the loop. Courts had previously
      been required to decide
      <em>first</em> whether a constitutional violation occurred, and <em
        >then</em
      > whether the right was clearly established. <em>Pearson</em> let courts skip
      the first question entirely. They can now dismiss on qualified immunity without
      ever saying whether your rights were violated. The result is a catch-22: the
      right never gets "clearly established" because courts stop deciding whether
      it's a right at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think about what that means. Every citizen is presumed to know every law —
      "ignorance of the law is no excuse." But police officers are held to the
      opposite standard: unless a court has already told them that this specific
      action is illegal, they're immune. The people with the most legal
      training, the most authority, and the most capacity for harm get the most
      forgiveness.
    </p>

    <h2>The numbers</h2>
    <p>
      A 2020 <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-police-immunity-scotus/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">Reuters investigation</a
      > analyzed 529 cases in which police were accused of using excessive force.
      Courts granted qualified immunity in the majority of cases — including cases
      where courts acknowledged the officers used excessive force but found no prior
      case specific enough to make the right "clearly established." Even when courts
      found the conduct unconstitutional, officers still walked.
    </p>

    <h2>Where that leaves you</h2>
    <p>
      Congress wrote a law that says the government "shall be liable" for
      violating your rights. The Supreme Court rewrote it so the government
      almost never is. The result is an access-to-justice gap so wide that most
      civil rights lawyers won't even take your case — the odds are too long and
      the economics don't work.
    </p>
    <p>
      So if your rights were violated, you probably can't find an attorney. If
      you file pro se, you'll face qualified immunity, heightened pleading
      standards, government lawyers with unlimited resources, and a system that
      was redesigned — by courts — to protect itself.
