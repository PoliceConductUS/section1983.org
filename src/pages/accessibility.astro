    <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
    <p>
      section1983.org is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people
      with disabilities. Civil rights are for everyone — and that includes the
      right to access information about civil rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      We strive to conform to the <a
        href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a
      > at the AA level.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Semantic HTML</strong> — We use proper heading hierarchy, landmark
        regions, lists, and navigation elements so screen readers can parse the page
        structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Skip navigation</strong> — A "Skip to main content" link appears on
        focus for keyboard users.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Keyboard navigation</strong> — All interactive elements are accessible
        via keyboard. The mobile menu is togglable and announces its state.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Color contrast</strong> — Our color palette is designed with sufficient
        contrast ratios. Text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements against all backgrounds.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No auto-playing media</strong> — We don't auto-play audio or video.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Responsive design</strong> — The site works on all screen sizes, from
        mobile phones to large desktop monitors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Focus indicators</strong> — Interactive elements have visible focus
        states for keyboard navigation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ARIA labels</strong> — Navigation, search, and dynamic content regions
        use appropriate ARIA attributes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Plain language</strong> — Legal content is complex by nature, but
        we write in the plainest language possible and link legal terms to our <a
          href="/primer">Pro Se Primer</a
        > for definitions.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Known Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Third-party content</strong> — Comments (via Disqus) and analytics
        (Google Analytics) are third-party services with their own accessibility profiles
        that we don't control.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mermaid diagrams</strong> — Our process flowchart is rendered as an
        SVG. While it includes text content, complex visual relationships may not
        be fully conveyed to screen reader users. We provide the same information
        in text form on individual process pages.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>PDF documents</strong> — Any linked court documents or PDFs may not
        be fully accessible. We provide HTML summaries where possible.
      </li>
    </ul>
