    <h2>1. Not Legal Advice</h2>
    <p>
      Nothing on section1983.org constitutes legal advice. This website provides
      general educational information about 42 U.S.C. § 1983 civil rights
      litigation and related legal topics. It is not a substitute for
      professional legal counsel.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>No attorney-client relationship</strong> is created by your use of this
      site, your reading of any content, or your participation in comments or community
      discussions. The Institute for Police Conduct, Inc. (IPC), its contributors,
      and its affiliates are not your lawyers.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are facing a legal matter, consult a licensed attorney in your
      jurisdiction. Many bar associations offer free or low-cost referral
      services. The <a
        href="https://www.nlg-npap.org"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">National Police Accountability Project</a
      > maintains a referral list for civil rights attorneys.
    </p>

    <h2>2. AI Disclosure</h2>
    <p>
      Some content on this site was researched, drafted, or edited with the
      assistance of artificial intelligence tools. We believe in transparency
      about this.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What AI helps with:</strong> Research assistance, initial drafting,
      citation formatting, and content organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What humans verify:</strong> All legal citations are checked against
      public court records (primarily <a
        href="https://www.courtlistener.com"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">CourtListener</a
      >). Legal analysis is reviewed for accuracy. AI-generated content is
      edited for tone, accuracy, and clarity before publication.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Limitations:</strong> AI can hallucinate — it can generate plausible-sounding
      but incorrect legal citations, case holdings, or procedural rules. Despite our
      verification process, errors may exist. If you find one, <a
        href="https://policeconduct.org/about/contact/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">please report it</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Use at Your Own Risk</h2>
    <p>
      You use the information on this site <strong>at your own risk</strong>.
      Specifically:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Laws change.</strong> Statutes are amended. Courts issue new opinions.
        What's accurate today may not be accurate tomorrow.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Courts disagree.</strong> Federal circuits frequently split on the
        same legal question. What's established law in the Fifth Circuit may not be
        in the Ninth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Facts matter.</strong> Small factual differences can change the legal
        outcome entirely. General legal principles may not apply to your specific
        situation.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Deadlines are unforgiving.</strong> Statutes of limitations, filing
        deadlines, and procedural requirements vary by jurisdiction and are strictly
        enforced. Missing a deadline can permanently bar your claim.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong
        >Before relying on any information from this site in a legal proceeding,
        independently verify it</strong
      > using primary sources (statutes, court opinions, and your jurisdiction's local
      rules).
