    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold text-navy mb-6">Get Involved</h1>

    <p>
      This site is a project of the <a
        href="https://policeconduct.org/about"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">Institute for Police Conduct, Inc.</a
      > — but it can't survive on one organization alone. The access-to-justice gap
      in § 1983 litigation is too wide for any single effort to close. We need people
      who've been through it, people who understand the law, and people who want to
      help.
    </p>

    <h2>Write</h2>
    <p>
      We're looking for contributors who can write from experience — not theory.
      If you've litigated a § 1983 case (pro se or as counsel), you know things
      that aren't in any textbook. What worked. What didn't. What you wish
      someone had told you before you filed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Articles don't need to be long or polished. They need to be honest and
      useful. We'll help with editing.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Pro se plaintiffs</strong> — Your experience is the whole point of
        this site. Write about what you learned.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Civil rights attorneys</strong> — Explain the things pro se litigants
        get wrong. Demystify procedure. You don't have to take their cases to help
        them survive.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Law students & clerks</strong> — Research and write about qualified
        immunity trends, circuit splits, or procedural traps in your jurisdiction.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>
      Every case cited on this site should be real, every docket number
      verified, every legal claim accurate. If you're an attorney or legal
      researcher willing to review articles before publication, we need you. Pro
      se litigants deserve the same rigor that paying clients get.
    </p>

    <h2>Partner</h2>
    <p>
      If you run a legal aid organization, civil rights nonprofit, law school
      clinic, or bar association pro bono program, let's talk. We can cross-link
      resources, co-publish guides, or build tools together.
    </p>
    <p>Current partners:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://policeconduct.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
          >policeconduct.org</a
        > — public police interaction reporting platform
      </li>
      <li>
        <a
          href="https://reddit.com/r/Section1983_pro_se"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener">r/Section1983_pro_se</a
        > — community for pro se civil rights litigants
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Build</h2>
    <p>
      This site is open source. If you're a developer and want to contribute
      code, improve accessibility, or help build tools for pro se litigants
      (complaint builders, deadline calculators, citation checkers), the work is
      waiting.
    </p>

    <h2>Volunteer</h2>
    <p>
      IPC runs on volunteers. Beyond writing and reviewing, there's outreach,
      research, data work, media, and community moderation. If you have time but
      aren't sure where you fit,
      <a
        href="https://policeconduct.org/volunteer"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">see our volunteer page</a
      >
      for current roles across all IPC projects.
    </p>

    <h2>Fund</h2>
    <p>
      The Institute for Police Conduct, Inc. is a nonprofit. Server costs, PACER
      fees, CourtListener API access, and development time all cost money. If
      you can't contribute time, consider
