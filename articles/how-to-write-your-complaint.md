## What a complaint is and why it matters

Your complaint is the document that starts your lawsuit. It tells the court what happened, who did it, what laws they violated, and what you want the court to do about it. It's filed with the court and served on the defendants.

For a § 1983 case, the complaint is often the most important document you'll write. Here's why: the defense will almost certainly file a [motion to dismiss](/primer/motion-to-dismiss) arguing your complaint fails to state a claim. If the judge agrees, your case is over — often before you get any [discovery](/process/discovery), before any evidence is exchanged, before anyone looks at the body camera footage.

The standard your complaint must meet is called [plausibility pleading](/primer/plausibility-pleading), established by the Supreme Court in [_Bell Atlantic v. Twombly_](/cases/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly) (2007) and [_Ashcroft v. Iqbal_](/cases/ashcroft-v-iqbal) (2009). Your factual allegations must make it _plausible_ — not just possible — that each defendant violated your constitutional rights. Legal conclusions don't count. Only facts do.

## Structure of a § 1983 complaint

### Caption

The top of the document identifying the court, parties, and case number (left blank until the clerk assigns one). Follow your court's local rules for formatting.

### Jurisdiction and venue

You need to tell the court _why_ it has the authority to hear your case and _why_ this particular court is the right one.

- **Subject matter jurisdiction**: 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 (federal question) and 1343 (civil rights). Your claims arise under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which is a federal statute.
- **Venue**: 28 U.S.C. § 1391. Usually the district where the incident occurred.

### Parties

Identify each plaintiff and each defendant. For defendants, include:

- **Full name** — not "Officer Doe" or "the officers." If you don't know a name yet, use "John Doe #1" and describe them specifically enough to identify them later.
- **Role** — badge number, rank, department, assigned unit on the date of the incident.
- **Capacity** — are you suing them in their [individual capacity](/primer/individual-capacity) (for money damages), their [official capacity](/primer/official-capacity) (which is really a suit against the government entity), or both? This matters enormously for what you can recover and what defenses apply.

### Factual allegations

This is the heart of your complaint. Tell the court what happened — in specific, factual, chronological detail.

**What works:**

- "On March 15, 2025, at approximately 2:30 PM, Plaintiff was standing on the public sidewalk at the intersection of Elm Street and Main Street, recording a traffic stop with his cell phone."
- "Officer Smith approached Plaintiff and said, 'Put that phone away or you're going to jail.'"
- "Plaintiff responded, 'I have a right to record.' Officer Smith then grabbed Plaintiff's right arm and twisted it behind his back."

**What doesn't work:**

- "Officers violated Plaintiff's rights." (Legal conclusion — the court ignores this.)
- "The officers were aggressive and hostile." (Vague characterization — not a fact.)
- "The officers conspired to deprive Plaintiff of his civil rights." (Conclusion without supporting facts.)

Every factual paragraph should describe something that _happened_ — what someone said, what someone did, what you observed. The judge should be able to picture the scene.

### Claims (Counts)

Each legal claim gets its own numbered section. A typical § 1983 complaint might include:

- **Count I**: [Excessive force](/primer/excessive-force) in violation of the Fourth Amendment (against Officer Smith in [individual capacity](/primer/individual-capacity))
- **Count II**: [First Amendment retaliation](/primer/first-amendment-retaliation) (against Officer Smith in individual capacity)
- **Count III**: [Monell liability](/primer/monell-liability) — failure to train/supervise (against the City)

For each count, identify:

1. The specific constitutional right violated
2. The specific defendant
3. The specific conduct that violated the right
4. How that defendant's conduct caused your harm

### Individual vs. official capacity

This distinction trips up many pro se litigants.

- **[Individual capacity](/primer/individual-capacity)**: You're suing the officer personally. You can get money damages. But the officer can raise [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) as a defense.
- **[Official capacity](/primer/official-capacity)**: You're really suing the government entity the officer works for. You can get injunctive relief (an order to change a policy) but not money damages from the individual. No qualified immunity defense, but you need to show a [Monell](/primer/monell-liability) violation.

Most plaintiffs sue officers in individual capacity (for damages) and also bring a separate Monell claim against the municipality.

### Monell claims

If you're suing the city or county — not just the individual officer — you need to establish [municipal liability under _Monell_](/primer/monell-liability). A municipality can't be held liable just because its employee violated your rights. You must show that an official **policy**, **custom**, or **practice** caused the violation — or that the municipality was [deliberately indifferent](/primer/deliberate-indifference) to an obvious need for training or supervision.

Common Monell theories:

- **Express policy**: The department had a written policy that authorized the unconstitutional conduct.
- **Widespread custom**: Officers routinely engaged in the conduct, and supervisors knew and tolerated it.
- **Failure to train**: The department knew officers were violating rights in a specific way and failed to provide adequate training. See [_City of Canton v. Harris_](/cases/city-of-canton-v-harris).
- **Failure to supervise/discipline**: Officers with repeated complaints faced no meaningful consequences, signaling that the conduct was acceptable.
- **[Final policymaker](/primer/final-policymaker)**: A person with final decision-making authority made the specific decision that caused your injury.

Each theory requires specific factual allegations. "The City failed to train its officers" is a conclusion the court will ignore. "The City provided zero hours of de-escalation training to patrol officers between 2020 and 2025, despite receiving 47 excessive force complaints during that period" is a factual allegation that supports a plausible failure-to-train claim.

### Prayer for relief

Tell the court what you want:

- Compensatory damages (for injuries, medical bills, lost wages, emotional distress)
- Punitive damages (available against individual defendants for egregious conduct)
- Declaratory relief (a court declaration that your rights were violated)
- Injunctive relief (an order requiring the department to change a policy or practice)
- Attorney's fees and costs (under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 — available even to pro se litigants for costs, though fee awards for pro se work are limited)

## Common fatal mistakes

### Group pleading

- ❌ "The officers arrested Plaintiff without probable cause."
- ✅ "Officer Smith grabbed Plaintiff's arm and placed him in handcuffs. Officer Jones stood three feet away and watched without intervening."

Each defendant must be connected to specific conduct. A judge can't assess whether Officer Jones violated your rights if you only describe what "the officers" did collectively.

### Legal conclusions instead of facts

The [plausibility standard](/primer/plausibility-pleading) requires facts, not labels. The court disregards conclusory statements entirely when evaluating a [motion to dismiss](/primer/motion-to-dismiss).

### Wrong defendants

Suing "the Police Department" often fails — in many jurisdictions, the department isn't a legal entity that can be sued. You may need to sue the city or county. Check your jurisdiction's rules.

### Missing elements

Each constitutional claim has specific elements. An excessive force claim requires facts about the severity of force, the threat you posed, and whether you were resisting. If your complaint addresses the force but says nothing about the threat level or resistance, the defense will argue you've failed to plead a plausible claim.

### Ignoring qualified immunity

While [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) is technically an affirmative defense (meaning the defendant raises it, not you), a well-drafted complaint anticipates it. If there's clearly established law from your circuit holding that similar conduct violates the Constitution, cite it. This won't prevent the defense from raising qualified immunity, but it strengthens your position when they do.

## Complaint element checklist

Before [filing](/process/filing), confirm your complaint addresses each item:

**For each claim:**

- [ ] Identified the specific constitutional right at issue
- [ ] Named the specific defendant(s) — by name, not just "the officers"
- [ ] Specified [individual](/primer/individual-capacity) and/or [official capacity](/primer/official-capacity)
- [ ] Alleged facts (not conclusions) supporting each element
- [ ] Connected each defendant to specific conduct (no group pleading)
- [ ] Addressed [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) exposure — are there similar cases from your circuit?
- [ ] Included damages — what harm did you suffer?

**For [Monell](/primer/monell-liability) claims (against the municipality):**

- [ ] Identified a specific policy, custom, or practice — or a specific failure to train/supervise
- [ ] Alleged facts showing the policy was the "moving force" behind the violation
- [ ] Connected the policy to a [final policymaker](/primer/final-policymaker) (for policy claims) or showed [deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference) (for failure-to-train claims)

**Procedural:**

- [ ] Filed in the correct court (usually where the incident occurred)
- [ ] Within the [statute of limitations](/primer/statute-of-limitations)
- [ ] Included a [jury demand](/primer/section-1983) if you want a jury trial
- [ ] Civil cover sheet completed
- [ ] Filing fee paid or [IFP](/primer/in-forma-pauperis) application attached
