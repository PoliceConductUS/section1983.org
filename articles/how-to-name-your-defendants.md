Your case name is permanent. The moment you file your complaint, the first defendant's name becomes part of the public record — in PACER, in <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CourtListener ↗</a>, in Google Scholar, in every database that indexes federal litigation. Journalists, future plaintiffs, hiring managers at other police departments — anyone who searches that officer's name will find your case.

That makes defendant ordering a strategic choice, not an administrative one.

## The case name is accountability

Consider the difference:

- **Turner v. Driver** — you know immediately this case involves an officer named Driver
- **Turner v. City of Arlington** — the officer disappears into the city's docket of hundreds of lawsuits

In the first version, Officer Driver's name is permanently associated with a federal civil rights lawsuit. If Driver applies to another department, a background search surfaces the case. If another citizen sues Driver later, your case shows up as pattern evidence. If a journalist investigates the department, Driver's name is in the public record.

In the second version, none of that happens. The city has hundreds of cases. Yours gets buried. The officer moves on with a clean search history.

The case name is the one piece of permanent, public accountability that your complaint gives you for free. Use it.

## Who should be Defendant #1

**The officer most directly responsible for the primary constitutional violation.**

Not the city. Not a supervisor who wasn't at the scene. Not "John Doe." The specific officer who violated your rights — the one whose name you most want permanently searchable.

If Officer Martinez arrested you without [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause) while you were recording police from a public sidewalk, your case should be **[Your Name] v. Martinez** — not [Your Name] v. City of Wherever.

The city goes in the caption too — you need the municipality for [Monell liability](/primer/monell-liability). But it goes _after_ the individual officers.

### The ordering principle

1. **The primary violator** — the officer most responsible for the main constitutional violation. This becomes your case name.
2. **Other officers directly involved** — backup officers who participated, officers who used force, officers who [failed to intervene](/primer/failure-to-intervene).
3. **Supervisors** — if you have [individual capacity](/primer/individual-capacity) claims against supervisors (they directed the conduct, knew about it and were deliberately indifferent, etc.).
4. **The municipality** — for Monell claims (policy, custom, failure to train/supervise).

Each officer you name is an officer whose name enters the public record. That matters.

## Multiple officers — choosing Defendant #1

When several officers participated in the violation, choose the one whose name you most want as the case name. Factors to consider:

**Who was the primary actor?** The officer who made the arrest, used the most force, or initiated the unconstitutional conduct is usually the right choice.

**Who has the most concerning history?** If you obtained [complaint data or use-of-force statistics](/process/foia-and-records-requests) during preparation, you may know that one officer is a statistical outlier. That officer's name in a case caption creates the most public accountability value.

**Who is most likely to remain in law enforcement?** A case named after a 25-year-old officer follows them for a 30-year career. A case named after someone about to retire has less long-term accountability value.

**Whose name is most distinctive?** This is a pragmatic consideration. "Smith" returns thousands of results. An unusual name makes the case more findable.

## What happens when you name the city first

Some pro se litigants put the municipality first because it feels like naming the bigger, more important defendant. This is a mistake.

**Lotts v. City of Irving** tells you nothing about which officers were involved. The City of Irving has been sued many times. Your case is one line in a long docket.

**Lotts v. Winegarner** tells you exactly which officer is accused of violating constitutional rights. That name is now permanently linked to a § 1983 case. Every future search for "Officer Winegarner" surfaces the lawsuit.

The municipality doesn't care about its name in a case caption — it has institutional resources and legal departments. The individual officer _should_ care. That's the point.

## The permanence of case names

Once filed, your case name persists across multiple systems:

- **PACER** — the federal court electronic filing system, searchable by party name
- **<a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CourtListener ↗</a>** — free public legal database (install the <a href="https://free.law/recap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RECAP extension ↗</a> to contribute your filings)
- **Google Scholar** — indexes case law and makes it searchable
- **Westlaw / LexisNexis** — commercial legal databases used by attorneys
- **News coverage** — journalists reference case names
- **Academic citations** — if your case makes new law, scholars cite it by name
- **<a href="https://policeconduct.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">policeconduct.org ↗</a>** — indexes cases by officer name, building accountability records

Your case name is not just a label. It's a searchable, permanent, public record that connects a specific officer to a specific allegation of constitutional misconduct.

## The name change problem

Case names can change as a case moves through the system. Defendants get substituted — officers leave the department, official-capacity defendants change when a new chief is appointed.

The most famous example: the case that became _Taylor v. Riojas_ at the Supreme Court started as _Taylor v. Stevens_ at the district court level. When the warden changed, the caption changed. By the time SCOTUS heard it, the name bore no connection to the original defendant.

**The district court name is the one that sticks in PACER** — that's the most searchable database. Appellate captions may change, but the original filing name persists in the district court record. Get it right at filing.

## John Doe defendants

Sometimes you don't know the officer's name. Maybe the officers at the scene didn't identify themselves. Maybe you were arrested at night and couldn't read badge numbers. Maybe the incident report lists badge numbers but not names.

You can use "John Doe" placeholders — "John Doe #1 (badge number approximately 4472)" — but this is a temporary fix, not a solution.

**Problems with Doe defendants:**

- **[Statute of limitations](/primer/statute-of-limitations)**: Some circuits toll (pause) the limitations period for Doe defendants until you learn the real name. Others don't. If your circuit doesn't toll, the SOL can expire before you identify the officer — and your claim against them dies.
- **Service**: You can't [serve process](/process/service) on "John Doe." Until you identify and serve the real person, the case isn't really pending against them.
- **No accountability value**: "Doe" in the case caption helps no one. It doesn't create a searchable public record. It doesn't follow anyone to their next job.

**Get the real names fast.** [FOIA requests](/process/foia-and-records-requests) for incident reports, dispatch logs, and body camera footage should identify every officer present. If the agency won't tell you who was at the scene, that obstruction itself becomes relevant evidence.

Once you identify the officer, you file a motion to substitute — replacing "John Doe #1" with the real name. In some circuits, this substitution relates back to the original filing date for SOL purposes. In others, it doesn't. Research your circuit's rule before relying on Doe placeholders.

## Practical tips

**Verify the officer's full legal name.** Use the name as it appears on official records — the incident report, the arrest report, department records. Not a nickname, not a shortened version. If the report says "Robert J. Martinez," your caption says "Robert J. Martinez," not "Rob Martinez."

**Check public records.** Some jurisdictions make officer rosters, badge numbers, and assignment information publicly available. Cross-reference what you have.

**Consider which name you most want searchable.** If you're suing three officers and one of them has a history of [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force) complaints, that officer as Defendant #1 creates the most accountability value.

**Name every officer who participated.** Even officers who "just stood there" may be liable under [failure to intervene](/primer/failure-to-intervene) doctrine. Every name you include is a name in the public record. Officers who watched a colleague violate your rights and did nothing deserve to have that recorded.

## The bigger picture

Every § 1983 complaint is a public document. Every defendant named in a complaint becomes a searchable data point. Over time, patterns emerge — the same officer named in multiple complaints, the same department producing repeat defendants, the same city paying settlements while officers face no consequences.

Your case is part of that record. The defendant names you choose determine whether your case contributes to visible, searchable accountability — or disappears into the anonymity of a city docket.

Name the officers. Put them first. Make the record.
