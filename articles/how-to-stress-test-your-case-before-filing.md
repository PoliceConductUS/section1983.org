You've gathered your [evidence](/process/foia-and-records-requests). You've organized your [war room](/process/organizing-your-war-room). You've written a draft complaint. You're ready to file.

Stop. You're not ready yet.

Before you file, you need to do the thing most pro se litigants skip entirely: **attack your own case.** Not gently. Not with optimistic hypotheticals. Attack it the way a defense attorney billing $400/hour will attack it. Find every weak point. Identify every assumption you're making. Test every factual claim against the question: _what if this isn't true?_

The complaints that survive [motions to dismiss](/process/rule-12-motions) and [summary judgment](/process/summary-judgment) aren't the ones written by people who believed in their case the hardest. They're the ones written by people who tried to destroy their own case first — and fixed everything that broke.

## The falsifiability test

Every factual claim in your complaint should be **falsifiable** — meaning it's specific enough that someone could challenge it with evidence. This is a feature, not a bug.

"The officer acted unreasonably" is not falsifiable. It's a [legal conclusion](/primer/plausibility-pleading) — the court will ignore it under [_Iqbal_](/cases/ashcroft-v-iqbal).

"Officer Smith struck Plaintiff in the head with a closed fist three times while Plaintiff was handcuffed and lying face-down" is falsifiable. The defense can challenge it — they can point to body camera footage, testimony, or medical records. But the claim is _specific_ and _testable_, which is exactly what the court wants.

Here's the key insight: **if you can't imagine what evidence would disprove your claim, the claim probably isn't specific enough to survive a motion to dismiss.** Vague claims feel safe because they're hard to disprove — but courts don't reward vagueness. They dismiss it.

For every factual allegation in your complaint, ask:

1. **What evidence would disprove this?** If you can't think of any, the claim may be too vague.
2. **Does that contrary evidence exist?** If so, you need to address it — either in your complaint or in your strategy documents.
3. **If this turns out to be wrong, does my case survive?** Some facts are load-bearing. Others aren't. Know which are which.

## "What if this isn't true?"

Go through your complaint paragraph by paragraph. For every factual statement, ask: **what if this isn't true?**

Not "what if the defense lies about it" — what if you're genuinely wrong?

- You say the officer had no [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause) to arrest you. **What if the officer can articulate a reason you haven't considered?** Did you say something that could be construed as a threat? Was there a dispatch call you don't know about? Is there a local ordinance you're not aware of?

- You say the force was excessive. **What if the officer perceived something you didn't?** Did someone behind you make a sudden movement? Did the officer just come from a violent call that put them on edge? (The [Graham factors](/primer/graham-factors) include "whether the suspect poses an immediate threat" — from the _officer's_ perspective.)

- You say the arrest was retaliatory for your speech. **What if the officer would have arrested anyone doing the same thing, regardless of the speech?** Under [_Nieves v. Bartlett_](/cases/nieves-v-bartlett), probable cause generally defeats a [First Amendment retaliation](/primer/first-amendment-retaliation) claim — even if the officer's subjective motive was retaliatory.

This isn't about doubting yourself. It's about seeing what the defense will see. Every "what if" you identify now is one you can prepare for. Every one you miss is a surprise in a courtroom.

## The officer's alternatives

For [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force) claims, one of the most powerful analytical frameworks is: **what else could the officer have done?**

The [Graham v. Connor](/cases/graham-v-connor) standard asks whether the force used was "objectively reasonable" given the circumstances. But "reasonable" is relative — it depends on what alternatives were available.

Go through the encounter moment by moment:

**Moment 1: First contact.** The officer approaches you. What was their tone? What were your options at this point? What were the officer's options?

- Could they have explained why they were there?
- Could they have asked questions before giving commands?
- Was there any exigency requiring immediate action?

**Moment 2: Escalation point.** Where did the encounter shift from conversation to confrontation? Who escalated?

- Did the officer issue a lawful order? Did you comply?
- If you didn't comply, was the order one you were legally required to follow?
- What de-escalation options did the officer have?
- Were there [reasonable](/primer/reasonable-suspicion) intermediate steps between "talking" and "using force"?

**Moment 3: Use of force.** What force was used? Was it proportional to the threat?

- What level of force does the department's use-of-force policy authorize for this situation?
- Was there a verbal warning before physical force?
- Were less invasive options available? (verbal commands → soft hands → hard hands → intermediate weapons → deadly force — did the officer skip steps?)
- Was the force continued after you were compliant or restrained?

**Moment 4: After control.** Once you were handcuffed or otherwise controlled, what happened?

- Did the force stop? Or did it continue after you were secured?
- Were you denied medical attention?
- What was said? (Post-arrest statements by officers can be revealing.)

Write out this moment-by-moment analysis. For each moment, document: what the officer did, what the officer _could_ have done instead, and whether the choice to escalate was justified by the circumstances. This analysis becomes the backbone of your excessive force argument — and it's exactly the kind of specificity that survives [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) analysis.

## Chronological consistency

Read your complaint from start to finish with one question: **does the timeline make sense?**

Surprisingly often, complaints contain internal contradictions that undermine credibility:

- Events described out of order with no clear reason
- Time gaps that aren't explained (what happened between the traffic stop and the arrest?)
- Contradictions between your narrative and the documents you've attached
- Facts that couldn't have happened in the sequence described (you can't have been handcuffed in paragraph 12 and reaching for your phone in paragraph 15)

**Build a master timeline** (see [Organizing Your War Room](/process/organizing-your-war-room)). Every event, with a timestamp and a source. Then compare your complaint to the timeline. If there's a gap, explain it or close it. If there's a contradiction, resolve it before the defense finds it.

The defense _will_ build their own timeline from your complaint, the police reports, and the body camera footage. Any inconsistency between your version and the documented record will be highlighted and used to attack your credibility. Find those inconsistencies yourself first.

## Have others read it

You've been living with your case for weeks or months. You know the backstory, the context, the emotional weight behind every sentence. A judge reading your complaint will have none of that context. They'll have 20 minutes and a stack of other cases.

**Before you file, have at least two people read your complaint:**

### Someone who knows nothing about your case

Give it to a friend, family member, or colleague who hasn't heard your story. Ask them:

- Can you follow what happened?
- Is anything confusing?
- Where did you have to re-read a paragraph?
- After reading this, do you believe a constitutional violation occurred?

If a non-lawyer can't follow the narrative, a busy judge won't either.

### Someone who will be honest with you

This is harder. You need someone who will tell you your case has problems — not someone who will tell you what you want to hear.

Ask them:

- What's the weakest part?
- Where would you attack this if you were the defense?
- Is there anything that sounds exaggerated or hard to believe?
- What questions do you have that the complaint doesn't answer?

If you can't find someone willing to critique your work, use [AI tools](/articles/how-to-use-ai-in-your-section-1983-case). Paste your complaint and ask: "You are a defense attorney. Find every weakness in this complaint and tell me how you would attack it." AI won't pull punches.

## The defense's motion to dismiss — write it yourself

This is the most valuable exercise you can do before filing.

Sit down and write the [motion to dismiss](/primer/motion-to-dismiss) that opposing counsel will file against your complaint. Include:

1. **[Iqbal](/cases/ashcroft-v-iqbal) / [Twombly](/cases/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly) arguments** — Which of your allegations are conclusions vs. facts? Where is your complaint conclusory?
2. **[Qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) arguments** — For each defendant, is there a case from your circuit with sufficiently similar facts? If not, what will the defense argue?
3. **Element-by-element attacks** — For each claim, which element is weakest? What evidence gaps exist?
4. **Procedural defenses** — [Statute of limitations](/primer/statute-of-limitations)? [Heck doctrine](/primer/heck-doctrine)? [Eleventh Amendment](/primer/eleventh-amendment)? [Standing](/primer/injury-in-fact)?
5. **Factual challenges** — Which of your facts does the defense have evidence to dispute?

Now write your response to that motion. If you can't effectively respond to an argument, your complaint needs to be strengthened in that area before you file.

This exercise typically takes a full day. It's the most important day you'll spend on your case. Everything you discover during this exercise is something you can fix now — in the complaint, where it's easy — instead of fighting about later, in a brief, where it's hard.

## Red flags to fix before filing

After stress-testing, look for these common problems:

**Legal conclusions masquerading as facts.** "The officer violated Plaintiff's Fourth Amendment rights" — this is a conclusion. Replace it with the specific facts that establish the violation.

**Missing elements.** Every § 1983 claim has elements. Have you alleged facts supporting each one? A [false arrest](/primer/false-arrest) claim requires facts showing (1) [color of law](/primer/color-of-law), (2) seizure, (3) without [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause), (4) causation. If you're missing one, fix it.

**Unsupported [Monell](/primer/monell-liability) claims.** "The city had a policy of violating rights" is conclusory. What specific policy? What specific pattern? What specific training failure? If you don't have facts to support Monell yet, consider whether to include it or save it for an [amended complaint](/primer/amended-complaint) after [discovery](/process/discovery).

**Emotional language that doesn't add legal weight.** "The officer's cruel and sadistic behavior terrorized Plaintiff" may be true, but "cruel and sadistic" is a legal standard for Eighth Amendment claims (prisoner cases), not [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment) [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force). Use the right legal framework, not the most dramatic language.

**Facts you can't source.** If you can't point to a document, a recording, or a specific witness for a factual allegation, consider whether you can prove it. Allegations you can't support become credibility problems when the defense challenges them.

## When to stop and file

Stress-testing can become its own form of procrastination. At some point, you have to file. Here's how to know you're ready:

- You can articulate every element of every claim and identify evidence supporting each
- You've identified your three biggest weaknesses and prepared responses
- You've written the defense's motion to dismiss and your response
- At least one other person has read the complaint and it made sense to them
- Your timeline is internally consistent and matches the documentary record
- You've verified that your [statute of limitations](/primer/statute-of-limitations) gives you at least 60 days of breathing room

You don't need a perfect complaint. You need one that's strong enough to survive a motion to dismiss, specific enough to put the defense on notice, and honest enough to maintain your credibility throughout the case. Perfection is for amended complaints — after you've seen the defense's hand.
