You need records. Body camera footage. Arrest data. Use-of-force reports. Complaint histories. Department policies. The documents that will turn your [complaint](/primer/section-1983) from conclusory allegations into the kind of specific, sourced factual claims that survive [_Iqbal_](/cases/ashcroft-v-iqbal).

The good news: these records are legally public in most states. The bad news: the agencies that hold them don't want you to have them — and they have a playbook for making sure you don't.

This guide covers how to get public records strategically, what agencies do to block you, and what your options are when they refuse.

## The strategic problem: don't tip your hand

Here's the tension most people miss. You need records _before_ you file your § 1983 lawsuit because the records make the lawsuit stronger. But the records request itself can alert the agency that litigation is coming — giving them time to prepare, circle wagons, coordinate stories, and in some cases, destroy or "lose" evidence.

You need to get the records without telegraphing the lawsuit.

### What tips your hand

- **Mentioning an attorney.** Don't reference legal representation in your request. You're a citizen requesting public records. That's it.
- **Requesting records for "litigation purposes."** Some state laws ask why you want the records. In most states, you don't have to explain. If your state requires a stated purpose, use something neutral: "personal records," "public accountability," or "journalism." Check your state's law — some (like Texas) explicitly say you don't need to state a purpose.
- **Requesting only records about yourself.** A request for "all records related to [your name]" screams pre-litigation. Instead, request by date, location, or incident number. "All body-worn camera footage from officers responding to [address] on [date] between [times]" doesn't identify you as the subject.
- **Requesting everything at once.** One massive, highly specific request draws attention. Multiple smaller requests spread over time look like routine public interest.
- **Sending the request from a lawyer's office.** If you have an attorney, have them advise you on what to request — but send the request yourself, from your personal email.

### What doesn't tip your hand

- **Requesting department-wide statistical data.** "All use-of-force reports filed in 2023" doesn't single you out. Neither does "arrest data by officer for the past three years." This looks like a journalist or researcher request. Agencies process these regularly.
- **Requesting policies.** "Current use-of-force policy" is a routine request. It tells the agency nothing about your intentions.
- **Using your state's online portal.** Many agencies have online request forms. They're processed by clerks, not the officers involved in your incident. The request is less likely to be flagged.
- **Spacing requests out.** The BWC footage request this week. The statistical data request next week. The complaint history request the week after. No single request reveals the full picture.

### The timing calculation

You want to balance two competing concerns:

1. **Get records before they know you're coming.** Once litigation is anticipated, agencies may invoke exemptions more aggressively, slow-walk responses, or (in bad-faith cases) alter or destroy records.
2. **Don't wait so long that the [statute of limitations](/primer/statute-of-limitations) becomes a problem.** If you're spending 6 months on records requests and your SOL is 2 years, you've used a quarter of your time.

A reasonable timeline: start records requests within 2–4 weeks of the incident. Pursue them aggressively for 2–3 months. File suit when you have enough to write a strong complaint — or when the SOL forces your hand.

## What it costs

Most records requests are cheap. Some are deliberately expensive. Agencies sometimes use cost as a weapon to discourage requests they'd rather not fulfill.

### Typical costs

| Record type                 | Typical cost      | Notes                                        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Incident/arrest reports     | Free – $0.25/page | Many agencies provide digital copies free    |
| Body camera footage         | Free – $25        | Some agencies charge for media/duplication   |
| Department policies         | Free              | Often already on the agency's website        |
| Dispatch/CAD logs           | Free – $5         | Usually just a printout                      |
| Statistical/aggregate data  | Free – $50        | May involve search time charges              |
| Personnel/complaint records | $0 – $200+        | Agencies often charge maximum allowable fees |
| Large data sets (3+ years)  | $50 – $500+       | Search time + duplication fees               |

### When cost becomes a weapon

Some agencies will quote you hundreds or thousands of dollars for records they don't want to produce. Common tactics:

- **Inflated search time estimates.** "This request will require 40 hours of staff time at $35/hour." Often wildly exaggerated. Challenge the estimate and ask for an itemized breakdown of how they calculated it.
- **Charging for review time.** Some states allow agencies to charge for time spent reviewing records for exempt material. Others don't. Know your state's law. Under federal FOIA, review time is only chargeable to commercial requesters.
- **Refusing to provide electronic copies.** Paper copies at $0.25/page for a 500-page production is $125. The same records as a PDF email attachment is free. If your state law allows electronic delivery (most do), insist on it.
- **Requiring prepayment.** Legitimate for large requests, but sometimes used to stall. Pay it if the records are important. Fight it if the estimate is inflated.

### Fee waivers

Both federal FOIA and many state laws allow fee waivers when disclosure serves the public interest. The standard varies, but common qualifying factors include:

- The records concern government operations or activities
- Disclosure will contribute to public understanding
- You're not requesting for commercial purposes
- You have the ability and intention to disseminate the information

If you plan to share findings publicly — through a website, social media, community organization, or news outlet — say so in your fee waiver request. You don't need to be a professional journalist.

## How agencies fight your request

### Tactic 1: Ignore it

The most common response to a records request is no response at all. The agency simply doesn't reply, hoping you'll go away.

**What to do:**

1. Send a follow-up referencing the statutory deadline: "My request dated [date] is now past the [X]-business-day response deadline under [state code section]. I request an immediate response."
2. CC a supervisor or the agency's legal department.
3. If still no response, file an administrative complaint with the oversight body (attorney general, records ombudsman, or open records commission, depending on your state).
4. Document every communication and non-response. This record becomes evidence of obstruction if you later file a [FOIA lawsuit](#when-you-have-to-sue).

### Tactic 2: Claim an exemption

Every open records law has exemptions — categories of records that agencies can withhold. The most commonly invoked exemptions in police records requests:

**"Ongoing investigation"** — The agency claims the records are part of an active investigation and therefore exempt.

- **Challenge it:** In most states, this exemption is limited to records that would _genuinely interfere_ with an ongoing investigation. If your case was dismissed, charges were dropped, or the investigation is clearly closed, this exemption doesn't apply. Ask for the specific statutory provision they're relying on and whether the investigation is still active.

**"Personnel records"** — The agency claims complaint histories, disciplinary records, or training records are exempt personnel files.

- **Challenge it:** This exemption varies enormously by state. Some states (like California, after SB 1421) have opened significant categories of police personnel records. Others remain more restrictive. Even in restrictive states, _aggregate_ data (number of complaints, outcomes by category) is often not exempt even if individual complaint files are. Request the non-exempt portions separately.

**"Law enforcement sensitive"** — A catch-all claim that releasing the records would compromise law enforcement operations.

- **Challenge it:** This exemption is supposed to apply to things like undercover officer identities, confidential informant information, and active surveillance techniques. It doesn't apply to body camera footage of a completed arrest, publicly available arrest data, or department policies that are already distributed to every officer. Push back with specificity.

**"Privacy"** — The agency claims the records contain personal information about officers or third parties.

- **Challenge it:** In most states, officers performing their duties in public have limited privacy expectations in those records. Bodycam footage of a public arrest is not private. Redaction of genuinely private information (Social Security numbers, home addresses) is appropriate — but redaction should be targeted, not used as an excuse to withhold the entire document.

**"Attorney-client privilege"** — The agency's lawyer claims the records are privileged communications.

- **Challenge it:** This applies to communications _between the agency and its attorney_ for legal advice. It doesn't apply to incident reports, BWC footage, arrest data, or department policies — none of which were created for the purpose of seeking legal advice. If an agency claims privilege over a factual report, they're misusing the exemption.

### Tactic 3: Heavy redaction

The agency produces records but blacks out large portions — sometimes entire pages.

**What to do:**

1. Request a [Vaughn index](https://www.rcfp.org/resources/foia-101/) — a document-by-document list of what was redacted and the specific exemption claimed for each redaction. Under federal FOIA, agencies are required to provide this on appeal. Some states have similar requirements.
2. Challenge overbroad redactions. If the agency redacted an officer's name from a use-of-force report, but the officer's name is already on the publicly filed arrest report, the redaction is indefensible.
3. Appeal each improper redaction specifically, citing the exact redaction and why the claimed exemption doesn't apply.

### Tactic 4: Delay

The agency acknowledges your request but takes weeks or months to produce records, sending extension notices and "processing" updates indefinitely.

**What to do:**

1. Note the statutory deadline in every follow-up.
2. Narrow your request if the agency claims the scope is the problem. Sometimes this is legitimate — "all records related to Officer Smith" is genuinely broad. But if you requested one specific BWC video and they're claiming it takes 3 months, that's obstruction.
3. File an administrative appeal after the statutory deadline passes.
4. Document the delay timeline. If you eventually sue, the court will want to see that you gave the agency a reasonable opportunity to comply.

### Tactic 5: Refer to the Attorney General

In some states, agencies can (or must) consult the state attorney general before releasing certain records. This adds weeks or months of delay and often results in a formal AG opinion that the agency then uses to justify denial.

**What to do:**

1. Track the referral. Ask for the date it was referred and the AG's expected response timeline.
2. Research prior AG opinions in your state on similar records. If the AG has previously ruled that similar records are public, cite that opinion in your correspondence.
3. If the AG sides with the agency, you still have the option to [file suit](#when-you-have-to-sue). AG opinions are advisory in most states — a court can disagree.

### Tactic 6: "No responsive records"

The agency claims no records exist that match your request — even when you know they do.

**What to do:**

1. Be specific about why you believe records exist. "I was arrested on [date] at [location]. An arrest generates an arrest report. Body camera policy requires activation during arrests. I am requesting those records."
2. Reference the agency's own policies. If their BWC policy requires recording during arrests, and they claim no BWC footage exists, ask them to explain the discrepancy.
3. File a preservation demand. If you suspect records may have been destroyed, send a written demand to preserve all records related to the incident. Use the word "litigation hold" — it triggers legal obligations, and destruction after a preservation demand is [spoliation](/primer/spoliation).

## The appeals process

Almost every records denial can be appealed. The process varies by state:

**Administrative appeal:** Most states have a first-level appeal — either to a supervisor within the agency, to a state records ombudsman, or to the attorney general. This is usually free and relatively fast (10–30 days for a decision).

**What to include in your appeal:**

1. The original request (attach it)
2. The agency's response or non-response
3. The specific statutory provision that makes the records public
4. Why each claimed exemption doesn't apply
5. Any evidence that the records exist (references in other public documents, the agency's own policies)

**Be specific, not angry.** Appeals are decided by people reading paper. A clear, specific legal argument gets better results than an emotional complaint about government transparency. Cite the statute. Cite prior decisions. Explain exactly why the exemption doesn't apply to these specific records.

## When you have to sue

Sometimes agencies simply refuse. They ignore appeals, invoke bogus exemptions, and wait for you to give up. Most people do give up. That's the strategy.

If your administrative remedies are exhausted and the records are important to your case, you can file a lawsuit to compel disclosure. This is separate from your § 1983 case — it's an action under your state's open records law (or federal FOIA for federal agencies).

### Is it worth it?

**Arguments for suing:**

- The records may be critical to your § 1983 complaint's survival at [motion to dismiss](/process/rule-12-motions)
- Many state open records laws award [attorney's fees](/primer/attorneys-fees) to successful requesters — meaning if you win, the agency pays your costs
- A court order to produce creates a record of the agency's obstruction, which may be relevant to your § 1983 case (pattern of concealment, [deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference) to transparency)
- Winning establishes precedent that helps future requesters

**Arguments against:**

- It takes time — months to over a year, depending on the court
- It costs money if you hire an attorney (though fee-shifting may make this viable on contingency)
- It delays your § 1983 filing while the SOL clock runs
- The records may not contain what you hope

### Filing pro se

You can file an open records lawsuit [pro se](/primer/pro-se). These cases are simpler than § 1983 litigation — the question is binary: are the records public under the statute, or aren't they? You don't need to prove constitutional violations or navigate [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity). You need to show you made a valid request, it was denied, and the denial was improper.

Many courts handle these on expedited schedules, and some states have specific courts or procedures for open records disputes.

### The in camera review

If you sue and the agency claims an exemption, you can ask the court to review the disputed records _in camera_ — meaning the judge looks at the actual records privately to determine whether the exemption applies. This is powerful because it prevents the agency from hiding behind vague claims. The judge sees what they're withholding and decides whether the exemption is legitimate.

## Preservation: protect what you might never get

Even before you receive records — and especially if you suspect they might be destroyed — send a written preservation demand to the agency. Address it to the chief of police, the city attorney, and the records custodian.

Include:

- The incident date, location, and any identifying information
- A specific list of records to be preserved (BWC footage, dispatch audio, CAD logs, reports, communications)
- A statement that you anticipate litigation and that destruction of responsive records would constitute [spoliation](/primer/spoliation)
- A request for written confirmation of the preservation hold

Send it by certified mail, return receipt requested. Keep the receipt. This creates a dated, provable record that the agency was on notice to preserve evidence. If records later "disappear," you have the foundation for a spoliation argument — which can result in adverse inference instructions at trial (the jury is told they can assume the destroyed evidence was unfavorable to the agency).

## State-by-state resources

Open records laws vary significantly. The best free resource is the **[Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press Open Government Guide](https://www.rcfp.org/open-government-guide/)** — a state-by-state breakdown of public records laws, exemptions, procedures, fees, and enforcement mechanisms.

For federal FOIA specifically, the **[Office of Government Information Services (OGIS)](https://www.archives.gov/ogis)** serves as a FOIA ombudsman and can mediate disputes between requesters and federal agencies.

## Key takeaways

1. **Request early, request smart.** Get records before the agency knows litigation is coming.
2. **Don't tip your hand.** Request by date/location, not by your name. Space out requests. Don't mention attorneys or lawsuits.
3. **Expect resistance.** Agencies have a playbook for denying requests. Know the playbook and have a response for each tactic.
4. **Appeal everything.** Initial denials are often wrong. The appeals process exists because agencies over-withhold.
5. **Document everything.** Every request, every response, every delay, every denial. This record has value beyond the records themselves.
6. **Be willing to sue.** Sometimes it's the only way. Fee-shifting provisions mean it may cost you nothing if you win.
7. **Preserve evidence.** Send a litigation hold letter early. Make it provable. If records disappear after your demand, that's powerful evidence.

The agencies that violated your rights are the same agencies holding the evidence of those violations. They know what's in those files. Getting access requires persistence, strategy, and sometimes a court order — but the records you obtain will be the foundation of everything that comes next.
