## What This Case Is About

Club Retro, L.L.C. v. Hilton involves a nightclub's § 1983 claims that city officials engaged in retaliatory enforcement actions in violation of the First Amendment. The Fifth Circuit affirmed dismissal, finding that the nightclub failed to establish the essential elements of its retaliation and selective enforcement claims.

## The Facts

Club Retro, a nightclub, alleged that city officials in Louisiana targeted it with selective enforcement of various regulations — including building codes, fire codes, and noise ordinances — in retaliation for the club owners' exercise of constitutionally protected speech and association. The club claimed that the enforcement campaign was designed to shut the club down and was motivated by animus toward the club and its owners rather than legitimate regulatory concerns.

The club filed suit under § 1983 against individual city officials, asserting First Amendment retaliation and equal protection selective enforcement claims. The defendants raised qualified immunity and moved for summary judgment.

## What the Court Decided

The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal of the claims.

On the **First Amendment retaliation claims**, the court applied the standard framework: a plaintiff must show (1) engagement in constitutionally protected activity, (2) an adverse government action, and (3) a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. The court found that even assuming the club owners engaged in protected speech, they failed to establish the required causal connection. The enforcement actions had legitimate regulatory bases — actual code violations existed — and the club could not show that those legitimate justifications were mere pretexts for retaliation.

On the **selective enforcement claims**, the court noted that to prevail, a plaintiff must show both that similarly situated entities were treated differently and that the differential treatment was motivated by an impermissible purpose. The club failed to identify sufficiently similar comparators who were not subjected to the same enforcement.

The individual officials were entitled to [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) because the club could not demonstrate a violation of clearly established constitutional rights.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

Club Retro v. Hilton illustrates the challenges of proving government retaliation:

- **Legitimate bases defeat retaliation claims.** If the government action has a legitimate, non-retaliatory justification, a retaliation claim will likely fail. Actual code violations or law violations provide that justification.

- **Causation is critical.** You must show more than temporal proximity between your protected speech and the adverse action. You need evidence that the adverse action would not have occurred "but for" the retaliatory motive.

- **Selective enforcement requires comparators.** To prove selective enforcement, you need to identify others who are similarly situated but were treated differently. Without adequate comparators, the claim fails.

- **Legitimate enforcement is not retaliation.** Even if officials have negative feelings toward you, enforcement of valid laws and regulations is not unconstitutional as long as there is an objective basis for the enforcement.

## Key Takeaway

Club Retro v. Hilton shows that when government enforcement actions have a legitimate basis — actual violations of law or regulation — courts are reluctant to second-guess officials' motives. To succeed on a retaliation or selective enforcement claim, you must produce evidence that the legitimate justification was pretextual and that the true motivation was to punish you for exercising constitutional rights.
