## What This Case Is About

_Bevill v. Wheeler_ is the continuation of Terry Bevill's [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) case against Wood County officials who allegedly conspired to have him fired from the Quitman Police Department for signing an affidavit critical of their professional relationships. After the Fifth Circuit's initial ruling in [_Bevill v. Fletcher_](/cases/bevill-v-fletcher) allowed the case to proceed past the motion-to-dismiss stage, the defendants raised [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) again on further proceedings. This second appeal addressed additional dimensions of the conspiracy and retaliation claims.

## The Facts

The underlying facts are the same as in [_Bevill v. Fletcher_](/cases/bevill-v-fletcher): Bevill, a captain with the Quitman Police Department, signed an affidavit supporting a venue transfer in a criminal case, stating that the defendant could not get a fair trial because of the close relationships among Judge Jeff Fletcher, District Attorney James Wheeler, and Sheriff Tom Castloo. The three officials then met with the Quitman mayor and threatened to withhold resources from the city and its police department if Bevill was not fired. Bevill was fired and sued under § 1983.

After the initial appeal affirmed the denial of the motion to dismiss, the case proceeded to further litigation. Former District Attorney James Wheeler (among other defendants) again raised qualified immunity, this time on a more developed record.

## What the Court Decided

The Fifth Circuit again addressed the qualified immunity defense and the viability of Bevill's claims.

**On the First Amendment retaliation claim**, the court reaffirmed that Bevill's speech—signing an affidavit about the fairness of local criminal proceedings—addressed a matter of public concern. The court analyzed the claim under the _Pickering-Connick_ framework and found that Bevill's interest in speaking outweighed any government interest in restricting his speech.

**On the conspiracy claim**, the court examined whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Bevill, plausibly established an agreement among the defendants to retaliate against him. The evidence of a coordinated meeting, joint threats, and the subsequent firing continued to support the conspiracy theory.

**On qualified immunity**, the court considered whether the right to be free from retaliatory termination for speech on matters of public concern was clearly established. The court held that it was—long-standing precedent establishes that government officials cannot retaliate against employees for exercising their First Amendment rights on matters of public concern.

The court also addressed the evolving landscape of retaliatory-action claims following [_Nieves v. Bartlett_](/cases/nieves-v-bartlett) and [_Gonzalez v. Trevino_](/cases/gonzalez-v-trevino), noting that the probable-cause defense to retaliatory arrest claims does not extend to retaliatory employment termination cases.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

**Qualified immunity can be raised repeatedly.** Defendants may raise qualified immunity at the motion-to-dismiss stage, at summary judgment, and even at trial. Each stage requires fresh analysis based on the available evidence. Surviving one round does not guarantee surviving the next.

**Conspiracy evidence must develop over time.** What begins as plausible allegations at the pleading stage must be supported by evidence as the case progresses. Discovery—depositions, documents, communications—is critical to building the conspiracy case.

**The _Nieves_/_Gonzalez_ framework.** The distinction between retaliatory arrest claims (where probable cause is generally a defense) and retaliatory employment claims (where it is not) matters. If your claim involves retaliation through employment action rather than arrest, you do not need to overcome the probable-cause hurdle from _Nieves_.

**Persistence pays.** Bevill's case survived multiple rounds of qualified immunity challenges. This illustrates that § 1983 cases with strong facts can withstand repeated attacks if the constitutional violation and clearly established law are properly established.

## Key Takeaway

_Bevill v. Wheeler_ demonstrates that First Amendment retaliation claims based on conspiracies among public officials can survive repeated qualified immunity challenges when the plaintiff establishes that the speech addressed a matter of public concern, the officials coordinated retaliatory action, and the right to be free from such retaliation was clearly established. The case also confirms that the probable-cause bar from _Nieves v. Bartlett_ applies to retaliatory arrests, not retaliatory employment actions.
