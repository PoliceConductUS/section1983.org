## What This Case Is About

_Presley v. City of Benbrook_ addresses the intersection of [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) and jury trials — specifically, whether a jury can simultaneously find that officers acted unreasonably and still grant them qualified immunity. It also addresses the constitutionality of Texas's failure-to-identify statute and warrantless entries into homes.

## The Facts

On July 11, 1988, Lieutenant Sam Horan and Officer David Wallace of the Benbrook, Texas police department, along with other officers, were attempting to serve a felony arrest warrant for sexual assault on Douglas Beckley, a man known to be violent, whom they believed might be hiding at his parents' house on Loch Ness Lane.

Louis Earl Presley drove down Loch Ness Lane in his blue pickup truck, passed the target house, turned around at the cul-de-sac, drove slowly back past the house, and continued to his own residence at 113 Loch Ness Lane. A detective believed Presley might be a friend helping Beckley escape and radioed Officer Wallace to stop him.

The accounts diverge. Wallace testified he approached Presley in front of his house. Presley refused to show identification or identify himself, stating he had no license there and didn't have to show one. Lieutenant Horan arrived and, based on Presley's belligerence and a general physical description of Beckley, became convinced this _was_ Beckley.

Presley acknowledged that after being told he was not under arrest, he turned and walked into his house without providing identification. Officers followed him inside, arrested him, and took him to the police station. Presley was not Beckley. He sued the officers and the City of Benbrook under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983).

## What the Court Decided

The case went to a jury, which found that the officers' conduct was "objectively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances" but _also_ found the officers were entitled to [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity). The Fifth Circuit affirmed both findings.

**Jury decides disputed facts on immunity**: The court held that when material factual disputes exist concerning the qualified immunity defense, "the jury, properly instructed, may decide the question." This is significant — it means qualified immunity is not always a question of law for the judge.

**The two-step analysis can diverge**: The jury could reasonably find that the officers' entry into Presley's home and arrest were unreasonable under the [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment), yet also find that a reasonable officer could have believed the conduct was lawful given the circumstances (searching for a dangerous fugitive, suspicious driving behavior, refusal to identify).

**Texas failure-to-identify statute**: The court also upheld the constitutionality of Texas Penal Code § 38.02(a), which requires a person lawfully arrested to provide their name, address, and date of birth. The district court had granted summary judgment on Presley's facial challenge to this statute.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

- **Qualified immunity can go to the jury**: Unlike most legal defenses resolved by the judge, when the facts underlying qualified immunity are disputed, the jury may decide. This is important — juries are often more sympathetic to plaintiffs than judges.
- **Unreasonable conduct doesn't automatically defeat immunity**: A jury can find that officers acted unreasonably _and_ still grant them qualified immunity — if reasonable officers could have disagreed about the lawfulness of the conduct.
- **Refusing to identify yourself has consequences**: While you may have a right not to identify yourself in certain circumstances, your refusal can contribute to officers' reasonable but mistaken belief that you are a wanted person — which supports their qualified immunity defense.
- **Warrantless home entry requires strong justification**: Officers entering your home without a warrant face heightened scrutiny under the [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment). But when they reasonably (even if mistakenly) believe a dangerous fugitive is inside, [exigent circumstances](/primer/exigent-circumstances) may justify the entry.
- **Mistaken identity cases can still fail**: Being the wrong person doesn't guarantee you win. If officers had a reasonable basis for their mistake, qualified immunity protects them.

## Key Takeaway

A jury can find that officers acted unreasonably yet still grant [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) — if the law was not so clearly established that every reasonable officer would have known the conduct was unlawful. When qualified immunity turns on disputed facts, the jury decides, making jury instructions critically important to the outcome of your case.
