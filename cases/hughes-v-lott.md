holding: "The Eleventh Circuit reversed the district court's dismissal of a pro se prisoner's § 1983 claims against City of Mobile police officers, holding that Fourth Amendment claims for unlawful search and seizure are generally not barred by Heck v.

## What This Case Is About

Ned Hughes, a pro se prisoner serving life sentences in Alabama state prison, sued several City of Mobile police officers under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violating his Fourth Amendment rights. Hughes alleged that the officers stopped, searched, and arrested him without reasonable suspicion, probable cause, or a warrant. After the initial stop, he claimed officers forced him to strip down to his underwear, held him against his will in the cold, and interrogated him while barely clothed. Officers also allegedly seized his personal property without a warrant and never returned it.

## What the Court Decided

The Eleventh Circuit reversed the district court's dismissal on multiple grounds. First, the court held that Hughes's Fourth Amendment claims for unlawful search and seizure were not barred by _Heck v. Humphrey_, because a successful § 1983 suit for Fourth Amendment violations does not necessarily imply the invalidity of a conviction—doctrines like independent source, inevitable discovery, and harmless error mean an illegal search can be followed by a valid conviction. Second, the court found that _res judicata_ did not apply because Hughes's earlier complaint had been dismissed _without prejudice_, which is not a final judgment on the merits. Third, the court held that the Prison Litigation Reform Act (42 U.S.C. § 1997e(e)) does not bar claims for nominal damages, even where a prisoner cannot show physical injury.

## Why This Case Matters for Pro Se Litigants

This case is critically important for anyone who was searched, arrested, or had property seized by police and later convicted. The court made clear that you can still sue the officers under § 1983 for Fourth Amendment violations even if your conviction stands—you just cannot seek damages for the conviction itself. This directly addressed a common defense tactic where governments argue that _Heck v. Humphrey_ bars all civil rights claims by convicted people. The court also reinforced that pro se pleadings must be liberally construed, and that nominal damages remain available for constitutional violations even when the PLRA limits claims for emotional distress without physical injury.
