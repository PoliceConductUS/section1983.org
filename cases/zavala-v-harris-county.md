## What This Case Is About

Stephanie Zavala was arrested for misdemeanor criminal trespass and booked into the Harris County Jail. While confined, she was attacked by other inmates while jailers allegedly watched. On a separate occasion, when she requested water from Jailer Napoleon Harmon, he placed her in a cell and used a hog-tie restraint, shackling her wrists to her ankles. Zavala sued Harris County and Harmon under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983), alleging [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force) and [municipal liability](/primer/monell-liability). The Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of all claims.

## The Facts

On September 12, 2017, Zavala was arrested for misdemeanor criminal trespass and booked into the Harris County Jail. While in custody, she alleged that other inmates punched, kicked, and threw her on the floor, striking her head on the concrete, while two unidentified jailers looked on for several minutes without intervening.

On a separate occasion, Zavala asked Jailer Harmon for water. Instead of providing water, he placed her in a cell and used a hog-tie restraint, shackling her wrists to her ankles. She alleged he was "annoyed with" her. Zavala filed a complaint with the Harris County Sheriff's Office of the Inspector General. She claimed that when she asked for water, Harmon pointed to the toilet area and told her she could drink from there. The combined toilet-and-sink area was unsanitary, though she did eventually drink from the sink.

Zavala's medical intake screening indicated she had a history of panic attacks, anxiety, and depression. She was exhibiting inappropriate behavior, screaming, singing loudly, and at times appeared incoherent with possible self-injurious behavior. Records also indicated she was having suicidal ideations and was hearing voices. By her own admission, Harmon placed her in the hog-tie restraint after she was "yelling for help" and exhibiting behavior described as inappropriate, disorderly, and self-injurious.

## What the Court Decided

The Fifth Circuit affirmed on all grounds.

**Monell claim against Harris County – Dismissed.** Zavala alleged that the County had a widespread practice of allowing excessive use of force in the jail, pointing to prior incidents of an officer beating an inmate, leaving an inmate in a squalid cell, and officers shooting suspects outside the jail. The court found these prior incidents lacked the "similarity and specificity" required under [Peterson v. City of Fort Worth](/cases/peterson-v-city-of-fort-worth) to establish a pattern constituting municipal policy. She did not allege prior instances where jailers failed to intervene during inmate-on-inmate violence or used hog-tie restraints in similar circumstances. She also failed to show deliberate indifference in training or ratification by policymakers.

**Excessive force against Harmon – Qualified immunity.** The court analyzed Zavala's claim as a pretrial detainee under the [Fourteenth Amendment](/primer/fourteenth-amendment) using the Kingsley v. Hendrickson objective reasonableness standard. Applying the Kingsley factors—the relationship between the need for force and the amount used, the extent of injury, the threat perceived by the officer, and whether the plaintiff was resisting—the court found Harmon's use of hog-tie restraints was not clearly unreasonable given Zavala's documented behavioral issues: self-injurious behavior, suicidal ideations, screaming, and incoherence.

The court noted that while "hog-tying is a controversial restraint," the Fifth Circuit has "never held that an officer's use of a hog-tie restraint is, per se, an unconstitutional use of excessive force." Because this was not an "obvious case" where the constitutional violation would be clear without directly on-point case law, Harmon was entitled to qualified immunity.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

**Hog-tie restraints are not per se unconstitutional.** Despite being "controversial," the Fifth Circuit has not categorically prohibited hog-tie restraints. Whether their use violates the Constitution depends on the specific circumstances—particularly the detainee's behavior and the threat they posed.

**Pretrial detainee claims use the Fourteenth Amendment.** Excessive force claims by pretrial detainees (those not yet convicted) are analyzed under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause, not the Eighth Amendment. The standard is objective unreasonableness under Kingsley.

**Pattern evidence must be similar and specific.** General allegations of past misconduct by the same agency are insufficient. The prior incidents must be factually similar to the plaintiff's situation—same type of force, same type of circumstances.

**Mental health history cuts both ways.** While mental health issues may explain why the detainee was acting out, they also provide the officer with justification for using restraints to prevent self-harm—making the force claim harder to prove.

**Documented behavioral issues help defendants.** When jail records document the plaintiff's disorderly, self-injurious, or suicidal behavior, those records provide a strong justification for the use of restraints.

## Key Takeaway

Zavala v. Harris County demonstrates the difficulty of bringing excessive force and municipal liability claims arising from jail conditions. The use of controversial restraint techniques like hog-tying is evaluated in context, and when a detainee has documented mental health issues and was exhibiting self-injurious behavior, courts are more likely to find the use of force was reasonable. Municipal liability claims require pattern evidence with factual similarity to the plaintiff's situation, not just general allegations of prior misconduct.
