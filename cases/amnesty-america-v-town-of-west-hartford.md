## What This Case Is About

Amnesty America and several individual plaintiffs—William E. Waugh, Suzanne C. Verdi, Harry M. Ong, Eleanor Brady, and Edward Dombroski—filed a class action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Town of West Hartford, Connecticut, and its police chief, Robert McCue. The plaintiffs alleged that West Hartford police officers used "officially sanctioned, intentional and malicious physical brutality and excessive force" against arrestees and pre-trial detainees during incidents on April 1, 1989 and June 17, 1989. The case was filed in 1992 in the District of Connecticut.

## What the Court Decided

The Second Circuit, in a panel that included then-Judge Sonia Sotomayor (later elevated to the Supreme Court), examined several important procedural and substantive issues. The court addressed whether the plaintiffs' excessive force claims were timely under the applicable statute of limitations, the requirements for maintaining a class action in § 1983 police misconduct cases, and the standards for _Monell_ municipal liability against the Town of West Hartford. The court ultimately affirmed the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the Town, finding that the plaintiffs' claims were barred. With over 900 citations, this decision has become a significant precedent in the Second Circuit for § 1983 litigation.

## Why This Case Matters for Pro Se Litigants

This case is critically important for anyone in Connecticut or the Second Circuit (which covers Connecticut, New York, and Vermont) who is considering filing a § 1983 excessive force claim. It underscores the importance of filing within the statute of limitations—typically three years in Connecticut from the date of the incident. The case also provides guidance on the challenges of bringing class-wide excessive force claims, which require showing a pattern or practice of misconduct rather than isolated incidents. For pro se litigants, the key takeaway is to act quickly: document everything, file promptly, and do not let the statute of limitations expire. Even strong claims of police brutality can be dismissed entirely if they are filed too late.
