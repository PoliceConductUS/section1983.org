## What This Case Is About

Carroll v. Ellington addresses excessive force claims arising from a fatal encounter between Harris County sheriff's deputies and a man with paranoid schizophrenia in his own home. The Fifth Circuit held that while the deputies were entitled to [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) on most claims, they were not immune from claims that they used excessive force after the suspect was subdued and had stopped resisting.

## The Facts

Herman Rochan Barnes (also known as Herman Rochan Carroll) was an African-American male who suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, a severe psychotic disorder. He had antipsychotic medication in his system at the time of the incident.

In 2006, Harris County sheriff's deputies responded to a call involving Barnes at his home. The details of what triggered the confrontation involved concerns about Barnes's behavior. When deputies arrived, a tense and chaotic encounter ensued.

The deputies entered Barnes's home and attempted to subdue him. Barnes resisted, and the confrontation escalated to the point where deputies used significant force. Barnes died as a result.

His surviving family members — the Carrolls — sued the deputies under § 1983, alleging that the deputies' warrantless entry was unreasonable, that the seizure of Barnes was unlawful, and that the deputies used excessive force in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The case went to trial, but the jury deadlocked and the district court declared a mistrial. The deputies filed an interlocutory appeal seeking qualified immunity.

## What the Court Decided

The Fifth Circuit reached a nuanced result:

**Warrantless entry and seizure claims:** The court found the deputies were entitled to qualified immunity. Given the exigent circumstances involving a mentally ill individual in crisis, the deputies' decision to enter Barnes's home without a warrant was not a clear violation of established law.

**Excessive force during the initial confrontation:** The deputies were entitled to qualified immunity on these claims as well. Barnes actively resisted the deputies, and given his size, strength, and the chaotic nature of the encounter, reasonable officers could have believed the force used was necessary.

**Excessive force after Barnes was subdued:** This is where the court drew the line. The Carrolls presented evidence that the deputies continued to use force after Barnes had been subdued and ceased resisting. The court held that it was clearly established that officers may not continue to use significant force against a suspect who has stopped resisting. On these claims, qualified immunity was denied.

The court applied the [_Graham v. Connor_](/cases/graham-v-connor) objective reasonableness standard, emphasizing that the calculus changes dramatically once a suspect stops resisting.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

Carroll v. Ellington is significant for several reasons:

- **Force must stop when resistance stops.** This is a foundational principle of excessive force law. Once a suspect is subdued and no longer resisting, officers must de-escalate. Continuing to use force after that point can be a clear constitutional violation.

- **Mental illness complicates the analysis.** Officers dealing with mentally ill individuals face unique challenges, and courts recognize that such encounters are inherently unpredictable. This may favor officers on qualified immunity for force used during the initial confrontation — but it does not excuse continued force after the threat has ended.

- **Qualified immunity is not all-or-nothing.** A court may grant immunity on some claims while denying it on others. The analysis depends on the specific facts of each use of force, evaluated separately.

- **Interlocutory appeals are limited.** On interlocutory appeal of a qualified immunity denial, the appellate court reviews only legal questions (materiality of fact disputes), not whether fact disputes are genuine.

## Key Takeaway

Carroll v. Ellington establishes that even in chaotic, dangerous encounters with mentally ill individuals, officers must stop using significant force once the suspect is subdued. The right to be free from continued force after resistance ceases is clearly established, and qualified immunity will not protect officers who cross that line.
