## What This Case Is About

_Hicks v. Stahl_ is a [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) civil rights action filed in the Northern District of Texas against seven City of Irving police officers and the City of Irving. Plaintiff Daphne Hicks, proceeding pro se, alleged constitutional violations arising from two incidents: a warrantless entry and search of her apartment (the "First Incident") and a subsequent forced entry to serve arrest and search warrants (the "Second Incident"). The court dismissed all claims with prejudice.

## The Facts

On May 5, 2011, Irving Police Officers Rowan and Turner responded to an anonymous disturbance call at Hicks' apartment (the "First Incident"). The officers allegedly knocked the peephole out of Hicks' front door and threatened to kick it down. Once the door was slightly opened, the officers forced entry, finding evidence of domestic assault and marijuana. Hicks and a guest were detained for four to five hours, during which Hicks alleged she was forced to disrobe in view of the officers, had her restroom usage monitored, and was not allowed to speak.

Sergeant LeCroy arrived approximately four hours later, allegedly dressed in army fatigues and a ski mask, repeatedly palming his holstered pistol while interrogating Hicks. Officers removed money, electronics, and other valuables from the apartment. A Drug Trafficking Search Warrant was obtained.

On June 23, 2011 (the "Second Incident"), Officers Long, Holbert, and Montanez forced entry into Hicks' new apartment with guns drawn to serve an arrest warrant and search warrant. Hicks alleged the officers entered her bedroom while she slept nude, grabbed her, handcuffed her, and arrested her, which she characterized as severely sexually traumatizing.

Hicks was subsequently convicted of Unlawful Possession of Marijuana (> 4 oz) by a jury on June 21, 2012, receiving a two-year sentence suspended for five years of probation.

## What the Court Decided

The court (Judge Jorge A. Solis) granted all three defense motions to dismiss, addressing each category of claims:

**Criminal statute claims**: Dismissed with prejudice. Private citizens cannot enforce criminal statutes in a civil action. Violations of criminal procedure do not give rise to private rights of action.

**State law claims against the City**: Dismissed with prejudice under sovereign immunity. The Texas Tort Claims Act does not waive immunity for claims arising from police protection or intentional torts. All of Hicks' claims arose from the same conduct as the alleged intentional torts.

**State law claims against the officers**: Dismissed with prejudice under the TTCA election-of-remedies provision (§ 101.106). By suing both the City and the officers, Hicks triggered the irrevocable election rule—she had to choose one or the other.

**Eighth Amendment claims**: Dismissed with prejudice. Hicks alleged no facts showing she was incarcerated, and complaints about the fact of incarceration (rather than conditions) do not state an Eighth Amendment claim.

**§ 1983 claims against the City**: Dismissed with prejudice under [_Monell_](/cases/monell-v-dep-t-of-soc-servs). Hicks alleged only that the City had a "negligent practice and custom of allowing its Police Department to Violate Individuals Civil Rights," but failed to identify a policymaker, an official policy, or a pattern of conduct. The court emphasized that conclusory allegations are insufficient—specific facts about the policy, custom, or training deficiency are required.

**§ 1983 claims against the officers**: Dismissed under [_Heck v. Humphrey_](/primer/heck-bar). Because Hicks had been convicted of marijuana possession based on evidence obtained during the First Incident, a finding that the officers lacked probable cause or used false warrants would necessarily invalidate her conviction. Under _Heck_, she could not maintain a § 1983 suit until her conviction was reversed, expunged, or invalidated through proper channels (direct appeal or habeas corpus).

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

**The _Heck_ bar is a critical trap.** If you have been convicted of a crime arising from the same encounter, you generally cannot bring a § 1983 suit challenging the officers' conduct until the conviction is overturned. The remedy is through criminal appeal or habeas corpus first, then § 1983 if successful.

**The TTCA election-of-remedies is absolute.** In Texas, if you sue both a governmental unit and its employees under the TTCA, the employees will be dismissed. You must choose one or the other. This is a common mistake for pro se plaintiffs.

**Conclusory _Monell_ allegations will be dismissed.** Simply alleging a "practice and custom" of violating rights is not enough. You must identify: (1) a specific policymaker, (2) a specific official policy or widespread custom, and (3) how that policy was the [moving force](/primer/moving-force-causation) behind your specific injury.

**Pro se pleadings get liberal construction—but not unlimited latitude.** Courts construe pro se complaints liberally, but they still must state plausible claims with factual support under [_Iqbal_](/cases/ashcroft-v-iqbal) and [_Twombly_](/cases/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly).

## Key Takeaway

_Hicks v. Stahl_ illustrates multiple barriers that can defeat a § 1983 case against the City of Irving: the _Heck_ bar prevents suits that would undermine criminal convictions; the TTCA election-of-remedies bars suing both the city and officers under state law; sovereign immunity bars most state tort claims against the city; and conclusory _Monell_ allegations fail the plausibility standard. Each of these barriers must be addressed in your complaint strategy.
