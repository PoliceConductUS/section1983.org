## What This Case Is About

_Poole v. City of Shreveport_ demonstrates the powerful role of video evidence in resolving [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force) claims. The Fifth Circuit affirmed summary judgment for the officers after reviewing dashboard camera footage that contradicted the plaintiff's account of the encounter.

## The Facts

On December 19, 2006, Corporal J. Creighton of the Shreveport Police Department was off-duty, driving his personal truck in plain clothes on Interstate 20. He tailgated Roger Poole, who was driving a semi-tractor without a trailer. Poole, annoyed by the tailgating, threw something at Creighton's car, splattering it with liquid. Creighton radioed for a marked unit.

Sergeant John Stalnaker responded, activating his lights and siren. Poole eventually pulled off the interstate into an empty lot. Stalnaker ordered Poole out of the cab, and Poole complied. He smelled of alcohol but passed a field sobriety test, admitting he had consumed half a sixteen-ounce beer that morning. He could not produce proof of insurance.

A dashboard camera recorded most of what followed. The officers issued citations and the encounter escalated — Poole alleged the officers used excessive force during the arrest, while the video told a different story. Poole sued under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) alleging excessive force against Corporal Creighton, Sergeant Stalnaker, and the City of Shreveport.

## What the Court Decided

The Fifth Circuit affirmed summary judgment for the defendants, relying heavily on the dashboard camera footage under the framework of _Scott v. Harris_, 550 U.S. 372 (2007).

**Video evidence controls**: Following _Scott v. Harris_, the court held that when a videotape captures the relevant events and "blatantly contradicts" the plaintiff's account, courts should view the facts "in the light depicted by the videotape" rather than crediting the plaintiff's version.

**The Graham factors favored the officers**: Applying the [Graham factors](/primer/graham-factors) to the events as shown on video, the court found the officers' use of force was objectively reasonable given the circumstances — including Poole's aggressive behavior, his alcohol consumption, and his resistance during the arrest.

**Qualified immunity applied**: Even viewing any remaining ambiguities in Poole's favor, the officers' conduct did not violate [clearly established law](/primer/clearly-established-law). A reasonable officer in their position could have believed the force used was lawful.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

- **Video evidence is a double-edged sword**: Dashboard cameras, [body cameras](/primer/body-camera-footage), and bystander recordings can make or break your case. If the video supports your account, it's your strongest evidence. If it contradicts your account, it can be fatal.
- **After _Scott v. Harris_, video trumps testimony**: When clear video evidence "blatantly contradicts" a plaintiff's version of events, courts will credit the video — not the plaintiff's sworn testimony. This effectively eliminates the factual dispute that would otherwise go to a jury.
- **Request all video early**: In [discovery](/primer/discovery), demand all dashboard camera, body camera, and surveillance footage immediately. If favorable video exists, it strengthens your case immensely. If unfavorable video exists, you need to know before investing heavily in litigation.
- **Your conduct during the encounter matters**: How you behave during a traffic stop — whether you comply, resist, or become aggressive — is likely recorded and will be evaluated under the [Graham factors](/primer/graham-factors).
- **Off-duty officers still act under color of law**: Corporal Creighton was off-duty in plain clothes, but his involvement in initiating the police response and participating in the arrest placed his conduct [under color of law](/primer/color-of-law).

## Key Takeaway

In the age of dashboard and body cameras, video evidence often determines the outcome of [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force) cases. Under _Scott v. Harris_, if clear video contradicts your account of events, courts will credit the video over your testimony. Obtain all available footage early in your case — it will either be your best evidence or your biggest obstacle.
