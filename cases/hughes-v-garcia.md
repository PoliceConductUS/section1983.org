## What This Case Is About

This is one of the most extraordinary [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) cases in recent Fifth Circuit history. Austin Thompson Hughes, a former police officer driving for Uber, called 911 to report a dangerously drunk driver on I-610 in Houston. After the drunk driver crashed, Hughes made a lawful citizen's arrest. When officers arrived, they let the drunk driver go and instead arrested Hughes for felony impersonation of a police officer — based on the drunk driver's rambling, self-contradictory, intoxicated statement. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the denial of [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity), calling this an egregious [Franks](/primer/franks-violation) violation.

## The Facts

At approximately 2:37 a.m. on March 23, 2019, Hughes was driving for Uber when he saw a white GMC Sierra swerving erratically, hitting barriers on both sides of I-610. Hughes dialed 911 and followed with his flashers on, his passengers audibly confirming his observations. After the truck crashed, Hughes approached, found the driver "obviously intoxicated," retrieved his keys and license, and used handcuffs — from his former law enforcement career — to restrain the driver after he tried to stumble into oncoming traffic. At no point did Hughes identify himself as a current police officer.

When Officers Garcia and Few arrived 17 minutes later, they re-handcuffed the drunk driver and took statements. The drunk driver told a "crazy" story (the officers' own lawyer's word): he called Hughes "Jesse," claimed they met at a flea market (none open at 2 a.m.), said Hughes was driving the Sierra (despite Hughes's Jeep being at the scene), and accused Hughes of questioning him about his wife. Despite these absurdities, the officers' incident report focused on charging Hughes — not the drunk driver — and was titled "Impersonating an Officer."

Two days later, Garcia submitted a probable cause affidavit that materially altered the drunk driver's statement to patch obvious holes, omitted Hughes's corroborating 911 call and Uber records, omitted the drunk driver's 6/6 failure on the intoxication test, fabricated a reference to an "Officer A. Walters" who appears nowhere else in the record, and presented the drunk driver's claim that Hughes said "I am a police officer" as credible.

Officers arrested Hughes at 3:00 a.m. at his home by tricking him into extending his arm through a cracked door. He spent over 24 hours in jail. Three months later, the State dismissed the case, finding "no probable cause existed."

## What the Court Decided

The Fifth Circuit affirmed the denial of qualified immunity for both officers. Applying the [_Franks v. Delaware_](/cases/franks-v-delaware) doctrine, the court found that Hughes adequately pleaded that both officers included reckless misstatements and material omissions in the warrant materials.

Against Garcia, the court identified at least eight material misstatements or omissions in the affidavit, including altered witness statements, omitted corroborating evidence, and the fabricated "Officer A. Walters." Against Few, the court found both direct liability (for submitting the misleading incident report knowing it would be used in the warrant) and bystander liability (for knowing Garcia's affidavit contained false statements and failing to act).

On the "corrected affidavit" analysis, the court found that without the misstatements and omissions, no probable cause existed. Hughes's actions constituted a lawful citizen's arrest under Texas law. The only evidence he impersonated an officer came from an intoxicated man whose story was internally contradictory and contradicted by every other piece of evidence.

The court pointedly observed: "It is unclear which part of this case is more amazing: (1) That officers refused to charge a severely intoxicated driver and instead brought felony charges against the Good Samaritan who intervened to protect Houstonians; or (2) that the City of Houston continues to defend its officers' conduct."

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

_Hughes v. Garcia_ is a landmark case for [false arrest](/primer/false-arrest) and [malicious prosecution](/primer/malicious-prosecution) claims based on [Franks violations](/primer/franks-violation). Key principles:

1. **Officers cannot lie in warrant affidavits.** The [Franks](/primer/franks-violation) doctrine — a clearly established right since 1978 — holds that reckless or intentional misstatements and omissions in a warrant affidavit violate the Fourth Amendment.
2. **The independent intermediary doctrine has limits.** A magistrate's approval of a warrant does not protect officers who deceived the magistrate with false information.
3. **All participating officers can be liable.** Not just the affiant — any officer who contributed false information or knew about the falsehoods and failed to correct them can face liability.
4. **Corroborating evidence matters.** The massive gap between Hughes's well-corroborated account and the drunk driver's incoherent story made the officers' decision to credit the latter clearly reckless.

## Key Takeaway

If police officers obtain your arrest warrant by including false statements or omitting critical exculpatory information — even if a magistrate signs the warrant — they are not protected by [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity). Under [_Franks v. Delaware_](/cases/franks-v-delaware), officers have a clearly established duty not to lie or recklessly mislead in warrant applications. If your arrest was based on a warrant affidavit containing demonstrable falsehoods or material omissions, _Hughes v. Garcia_ is powerful authority for your [false arrest](/primer/false-arrest) and [malicious prosecution](/primer/malicious-prosecution) claims.
