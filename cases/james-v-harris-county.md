## What This Case Is About

Deputy Sheriff William Wilkinson shot and killed Hiji Harrison during a traffic stop. Harrison's family sued Harris County under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983), arguing the county was liable because the sheriff's failure to thoroughly investigate officer-involved shootings created an expectation of impunity for [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force). After a ten-day trial, the jury deadlocked on whether excessive force occurred, and the district court granted judgment as a matter of law for the county. The Fifth Circuit affirmed.

## The Facts

On May 16, 2004, at approximately 1:20 a.m., Deputy Wilkinson stopped Hiji Harrison for speeding. According to Wilkinson, Harrison consented to a vehicle search, during which Wilkinson found a pistol. Wilkinson told Harrison he was under arrest and began handcuffing him. After one hand was cuffed, Harrison allegedly struggled, pulled Wilkinson into the backseat, and reached for a gun. Wilkinson shot Harrison once in the back and three more times in the face.

Harrison's family presented contradictory evidence: no gunpowder residue was found in the backseat, shell casing positions suggested Wilkinson fired from outside the car, and the autopsy showed no bruising consistent with a struggle. The family argued the county was liable because the sheriff's persistent failure to properly investigate officer-involved shootings amounted to a [custom](/primer/custom) of tolerating excessive force.

## What the Court Decided

The Fifth Circuit affirmed judgment for the county. The court held that even assuming the deputy used excessive force, the plaintiffs failed to establish [municipal liability](/primer/municipal-liability) under [_Monell_](/cases/monell-v-department-of-social-services). To hold a municipality liable, the plaintiffs needed to show that an official policy or [custom](/primer/custom) was the "[moving force](/primer/moving-force-causation)" behind the constitutional violation.

The court found the evidence insufficient to establish that the sheriff's investigation practices — even if inadequate — were the moving force behind Wilkinson's decision to shoot Harrison. The plaintiffs could not show that Wilkinson was aware of or influenced by the department's investigation practices when he made his split-second decision to use deadly force. The causal chain between inadequate investigations and this particular shooting was too attenuated.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

_James v. Harris County_ highlights the steep burden of proving [Monell liability](/primer/monell-liability) through a failure-to-investigate theory:

- **Moving force causation**: It is not enough to show that a department inadequately investigates officer misconduct. You must connect that practice to the specific officer's decision to use force. Courts require evidence that the officer knew about and was emboldened by the department's lax practices.
- **Custom vs. single incident**: To prove a [custom](/primer/custom), you need a pattern of similar incidents — not just general evidence that investigations were inadequate.
- **Jury deadlock**: Even when a jury cannot agree on whether force was excessive, the court can still grant judgment as a matter of law on the separate question of municipal liability.
- **Practical tip**: If you're pursuing a failure-to-investigate theory of [municipal liability](/primer/municipal-liability), gather evidence showing that the specific officer knew about prior incidents where other officers used excessive force and were not disciplined. Without that link, the causation element will fail.

## Key Takeaway

A county's failure to thoroughly investigate officer-involved shootings does not automatically create [Monell liability](/primer/monell-liability) — you must show that the inadequate investigation practice was the [moving force](/primer/moving-force-causation) behind the specific officer's decision to use excessive force, which requires evidence that the officer was aware of and emboldened by the department's practices.
