## What This Case Is About

Mellissa Marie Benavides was on community supervision (probation) for possession of a controlled substance—between four and 200 grams of a penalty group one substance, a second-degree felony in Texas. When the trial court revoked her community supervision and adjudicated her guilty, she was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. Her appellate counsel filed an _Anders_ brief, concluding there were no arguable grounds for appeal. The Thirteenth Court of Appeals conducted an independent review and affirmed the conviction.

## The Facts

Benavides had previously been placed on community supervision after being charged with possession of a controlled substance in penalty group one in an amount greater than or equal to four grams but less than 200 grams, under Texas Health and Safety Code § 481.115. This is a second-degree felony under Texas law.

The State subsequently moved to revoke Benavides's community supervision, alleging she had violated the terms and conditions of her probation. The trial court held a hearing on the motion to revoke. After considering the evidence, the 377th District Court of Victoria County revoked Benavides's community supervision and proceeded to adjudicate her guilty of the underlying possession charge.

The trial court sentenced Benavides to a six-year term of imprisonment in the Institutional Division of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.

Benavides's court-appointed appellate counsel reviewed the record and determined there were no non-frivolous grounds for appeal. Counsel filed an _Anders_ brief and a motion to withdraw, complying with the procedural requirements of _Anders v. California_ and its Texas progeny.

## What the Court Decided

The Thirteenth Court of Appeals followed the established _Anders_ procedure:

**Counsel's compliance.** The court first verified that appellate counsel's brief met the requirements of _Anders_—it presented a professional evaluation of the record with references to the facts, procedural history, and pertinent legal authorities. Counsel also demonstrated compliance with _Kelly v. State_ by notifying Benavides of the filing, providing copies of the brief and motion to withdraw, informing her of her right to file a pro se response, and providing access to the appellate record.

**Pro se response.** Adequate time passed, and Benavides did not file a pro se response.

**Independent review.** The court conducted a full examination of the proceedings, as required by _Penson v. Ohio_, 488 U.S. 75 (1988). After reviewing the entire record, the court found no reversible error and affirmed the trial court's judgment.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

While _Benavides_ is a state criminal procedure case, it has relevance for § 1983 practitioners:

**Probation revocations and § 1983.** If you believe your probation was revoked based on unconstitutional conduct by law enforcement—such as an illegal search that uncovered the violation, or false testimony at a revocation hearing—the underlying criminal proceedings must first be challenged through direct appeal or habeas corpus before a § 1983 claim can proceed, under the [Heck doctrine](/primer/heck-doctrine).

**The _Anders_ process as a safeguard.** When appellate counsel finds no meritorious issues, the appellate court's independent review serves as a safety net. Understanding this process is important because a conviction affirmed through _Anders_ review is a final conviction for [Heck](/primer/heck-doctrine) purposes.

**Revocation hearings have lower burdens.** Community supervision revocations in Texas require only a preponderance of the evidence, not proof beyond a reasonable doubt. This lower standard can make it difficult to challenge revocations on sufficiency-of-the-evidence grounds.

**Document constitutional violations during criminal proceedings.** If officers violated your rights during the events leading to your arrest or probation revocation, preserving those claims in the criminal case record (through suppression motions, objections, or other filings) strengthens any subsequent § 1983 action.

## Key Takeaway

_Benavides v. County of Wilson_ illustrates the _Anders_ process for affirming criminal convictions when appellate counsel finds no meritorious issues. For § 1983 purposes, the key lesson is that a conviction affirmed through this process remains intact and may bar related civil rights claims under the Heck doctrine until it is reversed, expunged, or otherwise invalidated.
