## What This Case Is About

Andrew Lee Jackson, a Texas prison inmate, was a defendant in a civil lawsuit. When he tried to mail a time-sensitive court filing — an affidavit of inability to pay — prison officials interfered with his access to the mailroom, causing him to miss his appellate deadline. He sued the prison director and officials under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983), alleging they intentionally deprived him of his right to access the courts. The Fifth Circuit reversed the district court's dismissal and held that Jackson stated a constitutional claim.

## The Facts

Jackson was incarcerated in a Texas prison while defending a civil suit in state court. On July 12, 1979, his attorney notified him that his motion for a new trial had been denied and that to pursue an appeal, he needed to either post an $8,000 bond by July 30 or file an affidavit of inability to pay by July 19. Jackson immediately prepared the affidavit and had it notarized the next day by the Assistant Warden, Jack Garner.

However, Garner denied Jackson permission to enter the mailroom or speak with a prison mail officer to determine the correct postage for sending the affidavit by certified mail. Jackson's allegations — uncontradicted in the record — showed that the denial was deliberate rather than a mere oversight. As a result, the affidavit was not mailed in time, and Jackson lost his right to appeal the civil judgment against him.

## What the Court Decided

The Fifth Circuit reversed the dismissal, holding that Jackson's allegations stated a claim for the intentional deprivation of a constitutional right. The court recognized that prisoners have a constitutionally protected right of access to the courts, grounded in both the [First Amendment](/primer/first-amendment-retaliation) and [substantive due process](/primer/substantive-due-process).

The court held that deliberately interfering with a prisoner's ability to file time-sensitive legal documents is not mere negligence — it is an intentional act that can deprive the prisoner of a constitutionally protected interest. The court remanded for further proceedings, noting that some issues might need factual development at trial or summary judgment.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

_Jackson v. Procunier_ is important for several reasons:

- **Access to courts**: Prisoners have a constitutional right to meaningful access to the courts. This includes the ability to send and receive legal mail in a timely manner. If prison officials deliberately interfere with that access, they violate the Constitution.
- **Intentional vs. negligent conduct**: Deliberate interference with legal rights crosses the line from negligence to an actionable constitutional deprivation.
- **Actual injury required**: To succeed on an access-to-courts claim, you must show that the interference caused an actual injury — here, the loss of the right to appeal.
- **Relevance to [pro se](/primer/pro-se) litigants**: If you are filing your [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) case from prison, this case supports your right to timely access to postal services and legal resources needed to pursue your claims.

## Key Takeaway

Prison officials who deliberately interfere with a prisoner's legal mail, causing the prisoner to miss a court deadline and lose the right to appeal, violate the prisoner's constitutional right of access to the courts — and that violation is actionable under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983).
