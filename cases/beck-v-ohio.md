## What This Case Is About

William Beck was stopped and arrested by Cleveland police officers who knew he had a prior gambling record and had received an unverified "tip" that he was involved in illegal activity. Officers searched him incident to the arrest and found clearing-house slips (evidence of illegal gambling). The Supreme Court held that the arrest lacked [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause) because the officers relied only on Beck's reputation and an unverified tip, and therefore the evidence found in the search must be suppressed.

## The Facts

On November 10, 1961, Cleveland police officers spotted William Beck driving his car in the city. The officers knew Beck and were aware that he had prior arrests and convictions related to gambling offenses (specifically, operating a clearing house for illegal numbers games).

The officers pulled Beck over and arrested him. At trial, the officers testified that they had acted on "information" and "reports" that Beck was involved in gambling, but they did not specify the source of this information or provide any details that would allow a court to evaluate its reliability. They also acknowledged that they had no warrant.

After arresting Beck, the officers searched him and found clearing-house slips in his sock—direct evidence of gambling activity. Beck was charged and convicted based on this evidence.

Beck challenged the conviction, arguing that the arrest lacked probable cause and that the search incident to arrest was therefore unconstitutional. The Ohio courts upheld the conviction, finding that the officers had probable cause based on their knowledge of Beck's prior criminal activity and the information they received.

## What the Court Decided

The Supreme Court reversed, in an opinion by Justice Stewart.

The Court held that the [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment) requires that a warrantless arrest be supported by **probable cause**—defined as facts and circumstances within the officer's knowledge that are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been or is being committed.

Applying this standard, the Court found the officers' justification for the arrest wholly inadequate:

- **Prior criminal record alone is not probable cause.** The fact that Beck had previous gambling arrests and convictions did not, by itself, provide probable cause to believe he was currently engaged in criminal activity. A person's past does not create a perpetual basis for arrest.

- **Unverified tips without detail are insufficient.** The officers referenced vague "information" and "reports" but provided no specifics—no informant's identity, no basis for the informant's knowledge, no corroborating details. Without more, these bare assertions could not establish probable cause.

- **The standard is objective.** Probable cause must be evaluated based on the facts known to the officers at the time, judged against an objective standard. The officers' subjective belief that Beck was involved in gambling was not enough.

Because the arrest lacked probable cause, the [search incident to arrest](/primer/search-incident-to-arrest) was unconstitutional, and the clearing-house slips found in Beck's sock were inadmissible as the fruit of an illegal search.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

**Probable cause has teeth.** _Beck_ establishes that probable cause is a real, enforceable requirement—not a rubber stamp. Officers cannot arrest someone simply because they "know" the person has a criminal history or because they received vague tips. This principle is foundational for [false arrest](/primer/false-arrest) claims under § 1983.

**Prior record is not a blank check.** If you were stopped or arrested based primarily on your prior criminal history rather than specific evidence of current criminal activity, _Beck_ supports your claim that the arrest lacked probable cause.

**Tips must be verifiable.** When officers rely on informant tips, courts examine the informant's reliability, the basis for the informant's knowledge, and whether the tip was corroborated by independent police work. Bare, unverified tips are insufficient.

**Suppression and § 1983 are related but distinct.** _Beck_ is an exclusionary rule case—the evidence was suppressed in the criminal proceeding. In a § 1983 case, the lack of probable cause supports a [false arrest](/primer/false-arrest) claim for damages, even if no criminal prosecution resulted.

## Key Takeaway

An arrest based solely on an officer's knowledge of a suspect's criminal history and unverified tips does not satisfy the Fourth Amendment's probable cause requirement. Officers must have specific, articulable facts suggesting current criminal activity—not just a hunch or a record. _Beck v. Ohio_ remains a cornerstone case for challenging warrantless arrests that rest on reputation rather than evidence.
