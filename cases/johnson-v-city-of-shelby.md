## What Happened

Petitioners worked as police officers for the City of Shelby, Mississippi. They allege they were fired by the city's board of aldermen, not for deficient performance, but because they brought to light criminal activities of one of the aldermen.

Charging violations of their Fourteenth Amendment due process rights, they sought compensatory relief from the city. Summary judgment was entered against them in the District Court, and affirmed on appeal, for failure to invoke 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in their complaint.

## What the Court Decided

The Supreme Court summarily reversed. In a brief per curiam opinion, the Court held that federal pleading rules "call for 'a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief'; they do not countenance dismissal of a complaint for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted."

The Court emphasized: "No heightened pleading rule requires plaintiffs seeking damages for violations of constitutional rights to invoke § 1983 expressly in order to state a claim." The Court noted that the Fifth Circuit displayed "some confusion" in its perception of the suit — no "qualified immunity analysis" was implicated because petitioners asserted a constitutional claim against the city only, not against any municipal officer. The Court distinguished [_Twombly_](/cases/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly) and [_Iqbal_](/cases/ashcroft-v-iqbal), noting those decisions "concern the _factual_ allegations a complaint must contain to survive a motion to dismiss" and were "not in point."

## What It Means in Practice

_Johnson v. City of Shelby_ is a critical safety net, especially for [pro se](/primer/pro-se-litigation) plaintiffs and anyone without a lawyer. It confirms:

- **You don't need to cite specific statutes**: If your complaint describes facts showing a constitutional violation by someone acting under color of state law, that's enough for a § 1983 claim
- **Substance over form**: Courts must read the complaint for what it alleges, not for whether it checks technical boxes
- **No heightened pleading for § 1983**: The same Rule 8 standard applies to civil rights cases as to any other federal claim
- **Pro se complaints get liberal construction**: While _Johnson_ involved represented plaintiffs, the principle is even more protective for unrepresented litigants

The case is a direct rebuke to courts (especially in the Fifth Circuit) that were imposing heightened pleading requirements on civil rights plaintiffs. It ensures that ordinary people who know their rights were violated but don't know the statutory framework can still get into court.

## How You Can Use It

- **If your complaint is challenged for not citing § 1983**: Quote _Johnson_ directly. "No heightened pleading rule requires plaintiffs seeking damages for violations of constitutional rights to invoke § 1983 expressly in order to state a claim." 574 U.S. at 11.
- **Oppose motions to dismiss based on form**: If defendants argue your complaint is "defective" for failing to organize claims under specific legal theories, cite _Johnson_ and Rule 8. "Federal pleading rules call for 'a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief'; they do not countenance dismissal of a complaint for imperfect statement of the legal theory supporting the claim asserted." 574 U.S. at 11.
- **Template**: "Under _Johnson v. City of Shelby_, 574 U.S. 10 (2014), Plaintiff's complaint need not invoke § 1983 by name. The complaint alleges that [defendant], acting under color of state law, deprived Plaintiff of [constitutional right]. This satisfies the 'short and plain statement' required by Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)."
- **Pair with _Iqbal_**: Paradoxically, the same _Iqbal_ that raised the plausibility bar also supports the proposition that complaints need not contain "detailed factual allegations." _Johnson_ reinforces that _Iqbal_ doesn't impose heightened pleading — just plausible factual allegations.

## How It Can Be Used Against You

- **Doesn't excuse implausible complaints**: _Johnson_ only held that you don't need to cite the statute. You still need plausible factual allegations under _Iqbal_. If your complaint lacks facts showing _who_ violated _which_ right, dismissal is still proper.
- **Substance still matters**: Defendants will argue that while you don't need to cite § 1983, you do need to allege facts supporting each element — state action, deprivation of a federal right, and causation.
- **Substance still matters**: Defendants will argue that while you don't need to cite § 1983, you do need to allege facts supporting each element — state action, deprivation of a federal right, and causation.
