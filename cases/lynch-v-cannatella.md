## What This Case Is About

Sixteen Jamaican stowaways were discovered aboard a grain barge heading up the Mississippi River. Instead of being processed by immigration authorities, they were turned over to the New Orleans Harbor Police, who allegedly subjected them to beatings, forced labor, hosing with fire hoses, drugging, and confinement in a steel shipping container. The Fifth Circuit held that even excludable aliens are entitled to due process protection from gross physical abuse and that the harbor police could not claim [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity).

## The Facts

In March 1985, sixteen Jamaican nationals stowed away on a grain barge bound for the Mississippi River. The vessel's owner, rather than notifying immigration authorities, arranged with the Port of New Orleans to have the Harbor Police detain the stowaways while the barge continued upstream.

Harbor police boarded the vessel with weapons drawn, handcuffed the stowaways, and chained them together. At the Harbor Police facility, they were locked in short-term detention cells with no beds, mattresses, pillows, or heaters. The stowaways alleged a litany of abuses: they were denied adequate bedding and toilet facilities; shackled and forced to wash official and personal cars to earn food; hosed with a high-pressure fire hose when they refused to shower in unheated water, slamming them against iron cell walls; beaten and threatened by individual officers; drugged via their coffee; and locked in a modified steel shipping container for return to Jamaica. One stowaway, Barrington Williams, was hospitalized. Another, Wesley Griffiths, alleged being beaten and drugged so severely he experienced personality changes.

## What the Court Decided

The Fifth Circuit issued a detailed opinion addressing multiple layers of immunity:

**INS Director Lambert**: Dismissed. His involvement amounted to negligence at most — he had no personal knowledge of the conditions or treatment. Negligence cannot support a due process claim under [_Daniels v. Williams_](/primer/substantive-due-process).

**Port Director Reed**: Dismissed. The conspiracy allegations were "bald assertions unsupported by any specific factual allegation." Reed had no personal knowledge of the conditions.

**Dock Board and Harbor Police Department**: As governmental bodies, they cannot claim [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) (which protects only individuals). Their dismissal motions were denied.

**Individual harbor police officers**: The court made a landmark holding — even excludable aliens, who enjoy fewer rights than lawfully admitted aliens, are protected by the [due process](/primer/fourteenth-amendment) clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments from gross physical abuse while physically present in the United States. The court rejected the officers' argument that because courts had not previously defined the precise constitutional rights of excludable aliens, they were immune from suit. The court held: "If the argument advanced by the harbor police defendants were sound, the Constitution would not have protected the stowaways from torture or summary execution. To state the proposition is to assure its rejection."

However, the court remanded for the plaintiffs to provide more specific allegations about which officers committed which acts and the severity of injuries to each plaintiff.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

_Lynch v. Cannatella_ establishes critical principles:

- **Universal due process protection**: All persons physically present in the United States — including undocumented immigrants and even excludable aliens — are protected from gross physical abuse by government officials under the [Fourteenth Amendment](/primer/fourteenth-amendment).
- **[Qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) and "clearly established" rights**: The right to be free from torture, beatings, and deliberate physical abuse by state officials is so fundamental that it is clearly established even when the specific class of plaintiff (here, excludable aliens) has not previously been addressed by the courts.
- **[Conspiracy](/primer/section-1983-conspiracy) pleading**: Bald allegations of conspiracy are insufficient. You must plead specific operative facts supporting the agreement.
- **[Personal participation](/primer/personal-participation)**: Individual officers must be connected to specific acts. A complaint must specify which officer did what to whom.
- **Governmental bodies vs. individuals**: [Qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) protects only individuals, not government entities. Municipalities and government departments cannot claim qualified immunity.

## Key Takeaway

Every person physically present in the United States — regardless of immigration status — is protected by the [due process](/primer/fourteenth-amendment) clause from gross physical abuse by government officials, and officers who inflict beatings, hosing, forced labor, and drugging on detainees cannot claim [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) because the right to be free from such abuse is clearly established.
