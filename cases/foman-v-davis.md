## What This Case Is About

_Foman v. Davis_ is the Supreme Court's foundational case on the right to amend pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a). The Court established that leave to amend should be "freely given when justice so requires" and identified the limited circumstances under which courts may deny amendment. Though not a [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) case itself, _Foman_ is cited constantly in civil rights litigation when plaintiffs seek to fix deficiencies in their complaints.

## The Facts

The case arose from a relatively straightforward civil dispute. Foman's original complaint was dismissed by the district court, and she sought to file an [amended complaint](/primer/amended-complaint) to cure the deficiencies. The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal without addressing whether Foman should have been granted leave to amend.

The Supreme Court granted certiorari to address whether the lower courts had properly applied Rule 15(a), which states that leave to amend "shall be freely given when justice so requires."

## What the Court Decided

The Supreme Court reversed, holding that the lower courts had not properly applied the liberal amendment standard of Rule 15(a). Justice Goldberg, writing for the Court, laid out the standard that has governed amendment practice for over six decades:

Leave to amend should be freely given unless there is:

1. **Undue delay** in seeking the amendment
2. **Bad faith or dilatory motive** on the part of the movant
3. **Repeated failure to cure deficiencies** by amendments previously allowed
4. **Undue prejudice** to the opposing party
5. **Futility of the amendment** — the proposed amendment would not survive a motion to dismiss

The Court emphasized that the mandate of Rule 15(a) is to be heeded, and that "[i]n the absence of any apparent or declared reason — such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc. — the leave sought should, as the rules require, be 'freely given.'" 371 U.S. at 182.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

_Foman_ is one of the most frequently cited cases in federal civil rights litigation, and for good reason. Many § 1983 complaints — especially those filed by [pro se](/primer/pro-se) plaintiffs — contain deficiencies that courts identify on a [motion to dismiss](/primer/motion-to-dismiss). When that happens, _Foman_ is your authority for the right to amend your complaint rather than having it dismissed outright.

If a court dismisses your complaint under [_Ashcroft v. Iqbal_](/cases/ashcroft-v-iqbal) or [_Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly_](/cases/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly) for insufficient factual allegations, _Foman_ says you should generally get a chance to fix the problem. Courts that deny leave to amend without explaining why — or that dismiss with prejudice on the first go-round without offering an opportunity to amend — are often reversed on appeal.

The key exception is futility: if no amendment could save your claim (for example, if [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) clearly applies regardless of what facts you add), the court need not grant leave to amend.

## Key Takeaway

If your § 1983 complaint gets dismissed, don't assume the fight is over. Under _Foman v. Davis_, you are entitled to amend your complaint unless the court identifies a specific reason to deny leave — such as futility, bad faith, or repeated failure to fix known problems. Always request leave to amend in your response to a motion to dismiss, and cite _Foman_ for the proposition that the rules require amendment to be "freely given when justice so requires."
