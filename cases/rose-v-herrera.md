## What This Case Is About

_Rose v. Herrera_ demonstrates how well-pleaded factual allegations of [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force) can survive a [motion to dismiss](/primer/motion-to-dismiss) and overcome a [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) defense at the pleading stage. The court denied qualified immunity because the plaintiff's factual allegations, taken as true, stated a plausible [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment) violation under [clearly established law](/primer/clearly-established-law).

## The Facts

The plaintiff, Rose, alleged that officers used excessive force during an arrest in El Paso, Texas. According to the complaint, the force applied was disproportionate to any resistance offered and to the severity of the alleged offense. The officers argued they were entitled to qualified immunity and moved to dismiss the case before any discovery.

The specific allegations included detailed factual assertions about what the officers did, the force they applied, the plaintiff's level of resistance (or lack thereof), and the injuries sustained. The complaint was structured to meet the [plausibility pleading](/primer/plausibility-pleading) standard established by _Ashcroft v. Iqbal_.

## What the Court Decided

The court denied the officers' motion to dismiss, holding that the plaintiff's allegations were sufficient to state a plausible claim for excessive force that survived qualified immunity at the pleading stage.

**Factual allegations taken as true**: At the [motion to dismiss](/primer/motion-to-dismiss) stage, the court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor. Under this standard, the plaintiff's account of the arrest stated a plausible [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment) violation.

**Graham factors at the pleading stage**: Applying the [Graham factors](/primer/graham-factors) to the alleged facts — the severity of the crime, whether the suspect posed an immediate threat, and whether the suspect was actively resisting — the court found that the force described was potentially disproportionate to the situation.

**Clearly established law**: The right to be free from excessive force during an arrest — where the suspect is not resisting and the offense is minor — was clearly established at the time of the incident. The factual allegations, taken as true, brought the case within the scope of existing precedent.

**Qualified immunity is not automatic at the pleading stage**: The court emphasized that while qualified immunity can be raised in a motion to dismiss, it often cannot be resolved without factual development. When the complaint alleges specific facts that, if true, would constitute a clearly established violation, dismissal is inappropriate.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

- **Specificity in your complaint is crucial**: To survive a [motion to dismiss](/primer/motion-to-dismiss) asserting qualified immunity, your complaint must contain specific, detailed factual allegations — not conclusory statements. Describe exactly what each officer did, when, and what injuries resulted.
- **Qualified immunity at the pleading stage is hard to win**: Officers prefer to resolve qualified immunity before [discovery](/primer/discovery), but courts will deny dismissal when the factual allegations, taken as true, state a plausible violation of clearly established law.
- **Use the Graham factors to structure your complaint**: Organize your factual allegations around the [Graham factors](/primer/graham-factors): (1) what crime was alleged, (2) whether you posed a threat, (3) whether you were resisting. If your facts show a minor offense, no threat, and no resistance, your complaint is strong.
- **Allege lack of resistance explicitly**: Stating that you "did not resist" or "complied with all commands" is critical. Courts look for this language when evaluating the proportionality of force at the pleading stage.
- **The fight continues after surviving dismissal**: Surviving a motion to dismiss is just the first battle. Officers will raise qualified immunity again at [summary judgment](/primer/summary-judgment) after discovery, with the benefit of additional evidence.

## Key Takeaway

A well-pleaded excessive force complaint with specific factual allegations about what each officer did, your level of resistance, and the injuries you suffered will survive a [motion to dismiss](/primer/motion-to-dismiss) asserting [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity). Front-load your complaint with granular detail — time, place, each officer's specific actions, your compliance, and your injuries — to clear this critical early hurdle.
