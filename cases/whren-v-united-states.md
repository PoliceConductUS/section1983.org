## What This Case Is About

Whren v. United States is a unanimous Supreme Court decision that definitively settled the question of whether officers can use minor traffic violations as a pretext for investigating other crimes. The Court held that as long as officers have [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause) to believe a traffic violation has occurred, the stop is constitutional under the [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment)—regardless of the officers' actual motivations. This decision is one of the most significant cases in modern Fourth Amendment law and affects virtually every [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) case arising from a traffic stop.

## The Facts

On the evening of June 10, 1993, plainclothes vice-squad officers of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department were patrolling a "high drug area" in an unmarked vehicle. Their suspicions were aroused when they passed a dark Pathfinder truck with temporary license plates and youthful occupants waiting at a stop sign for an unusually long time—more than 20 seconds. The driver was looking down into the lap of the passenger.

When the police car made a U-turn to head back toward the truck, the Pathfinder turned suddenly without signaling and sped off at an "unreasonable" speed. The officers followed and pulled alongside the truck when it stopped at a red light. Officer Ephraim Soto stepped out, approached the driver's window, and immediately observed two large plastic bags of what appeared to be crack cocaine in petitioner Michael Whren's hands. Both Whren and the driver, James Brown, were arrested.

Whren and Brown were charged with federal drug crimes. Before trial, they moved to suppress the evidence, arguing that the stop was not justified by reasonable suspicion of drug activity and that the traffic-violation basis was pretextual. They acknowledged that Officer Soto had probable cause to believe traffic violations had occurred but argued that, in the "unique context of civil traffic regulations," probable cause should not be enough—the test should be whether a reasonable officer would have made the stop for the purpose of enforcing the traffic violation.

## What the Court Decided

In a unanimous opinion authored by Justice Scalia, the Supreme Court rejected the defendants' arguments and affirmed the convictions.

The Court held that the Fourth Amendment's "reasonableness" requirement is satisfied when an officer has probable cause to believe a traffic violation has occurred, regardless of the officer's subjective motivations:

> "Subjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis."

The Court rejected the proposed "reasonable officer" test—whether a reasonable officer would have made the stop for the stated reason—as an impractical, subjective inquiry disguised as an objective one. The Court noted that such a test would make Fourth Amendment protections vary from place to place and time to time, depending on local law enforcement practices.

The Court acknowledged the legitimate concern that traffic stops could be used as a tool for racial profiling, but held that the remedy for intentionally discriminatory enforcement is the Equal Protection Clause, not the Fourth Amendment.

The Court also rejected the argument that the balancing of interests inherent in Fourth Amendment analysis should weigh against enforcement of minor traffic laws by plainclothes officers in unmarked vehicles. Where probable cause exists, the Court found it unnecessary to engage in balancing unless the search or seizure was conducted in an "extraordinary manner, unusually harmful to an individual's privacy or even physical interests"—and a traffic stop out of uniform did not qualify.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

**Pretextual stops are constitutional.** After Whren, officers can stop any vehicle for any observed traffic violation, even if their real motivation is to investigate something else entirely. This makes it extremely difficult to challenge the legality of a traffic stop under the Fourth Amendment if any traffic violation was committed.

**The officer's subjective intent is irrelevant.** You cannot defeat a traffic stop by showing the officer had ulterior motives. The only question is whether the officer had objective probable cause for the stop. This is a significant hurdle for § 1983 plaintiffs.

**Racial profiling claims go through the Equal Protection Clause.** If you believe you were stopped because of your race, the Fourth Amendment is not your avenue. Instead, you must bring an Equal Protection claim under the Fourteenth Amendment, which requires showing intentional discrimination—a significantly harder standard.

**Virtually every driver can be stopped.** The Court implicitly recognized that traffic regulations are so comprehensive that "total compliance . . . is nearly impossible." This means officers can find a legal basis to stop virtually anyone, which makes the Fourth Amendment a weak tool for challenging traffic-stop-initiated encounters.

## Key Takeaway

Whren v. United States holds that any traffic stop supported by probable cause to believe a traffic violation occurred is constitutional under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the officer's true motivation. For § 1983 plaintiffs, this means that challenging a traffic stop requires showing that no objective traffic violation existed—not that the officer had improper motives. The decision effectively removed the Fourth Amendment as a tool for combating pretextual stops, directing such claims instead to the Equal Protection Clause.
