## What This Case Is About

_Pfannstiel v. City of Marion_ involves a civil rights action arising from a confrontation between law enforcement officers and citizens in Marion, Texas. The Fifth Circuit reversed the district court's denial of [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity), holding that the district court had erroneously applied a subjective standard to the immunity analysis rather than the objective standard required by _Harlow v. Fitzgerald_.

## The Facts

On July 31, 1985, a group of between thirty and sixty people were socializing at a vacant lot in Marion, Texas. Chief of Police Earl, several police officers, TABC representatives, and railroad security agents approached the group, announced that the lot was private property, and asked the group to leave. Plaintiff David Vizza, who was seated in a chair, requested identification from the officials and protested. He was pulled out of his chair and arrested for criminal trespass.

Plaintiff Roy Vizza became upset upon seeing his brother arrested and expressed his feelings. He was instructed to leave but moved to the center of the highway and continued protesting. Officers chased and arrested him in an alley.

Plaintiff Pfannstiel heard about Roy Vizza's arrest and went to investigate. Words were exchanged with defendants Elliot and Earl. Earl allegedly "backhanded" Pfannstiel across the face. Earl and Pearce put Pfannstiel in a headlock and arrested him. Plaintiff Garza confronted the arresting officers and was also arrested.

Earl drove the arrested plaintiffs to the Guadalupe County jail at approximately seventy miles per hour, braking suddenly and causing Pfannstiel to strike his face against the metal screen. Upon arrival, the plaintiffs requested medical attention, which was denied. They were released after posting bond approximately three hours later.

## What the Court Decided

The Fifth Circuit reversed the district court's denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.

The district court had denied the officers' motions for summary judgment because plaintiffs alleged that defendants acted with intent to injure, reasoning that this allegation raised a disputed issue of material fact. The Fifth Circuit held this was error.

The court explained that under _Harlow v. Fitzgerald_, the Supreme Court eliminated the subjective component of qualified immunity in cases involving intentional conduct by public officials. The appropriate standard is "the objective reasonableness of an official's conduct, as measured by reference to clearly established law." An allegation of malice is not sufficient to defeat immunity if the defendant acted in an objectively reasonable manner. The district court erroneously applied a subjective standard to the qualified immunity issue.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

- **Qualified immunity uses an objective standard**: Even if you allege that officers acted with malice or intent to injure, this does not defeat qualified immunity if their conduct was objectively reasonable under clearly established law.
- **The subjective motivations of officers are irrelevant**: After _Harlow v. Fitzgerald_, courts do not inquire into the officer's actual state of mind when evaluating qualified immunity — only whether a reasonable officer could have believed the conduct was lawful.
- **Interlocutory appeal is available for qualified immunity denials**: When a district court denies qualified immunity on summary judgment, the denial is immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine to the extent it turns on an issue of law.

## Key Takeaway

Alleging that officers acted with malice or intent to injure does not defeat [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) if the officers' conduct was objectively reasonable under [clearly established law](/primer/clearly-established-law). The Fifth Circuit applies a purely objective standard — what matters is whether a reasonable officer could have believed the conduct was lawful, not whether the officer actually harbored ill intent.
