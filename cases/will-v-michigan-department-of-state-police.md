## What Happened

Ray Will was a Michigan state police officer who was denied a promotion. He sued the Michigan Department of State Police and the Director of State Police in both individual and official capacity, alleging the denial violated his constitutional rights under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983).

The Michigan Supreme Court held that § 1983 did not authorize suits against states. Will appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

## What the Court Decided

In a 5-4 decision by Justice White, the Supreme Court affirmed. The Court held that **states are not "persons"** within the meaning of § 1983 and therefore cannot be sued under the statute. The Court also held that **state officials acting in their official capacity** are not "persons" for purposes of § 1983 damages actions, because an official-capacity suit is simply another way of suing the state itself.

The reasoning rested on two pillars:

1. **Statutory interpretation**: Congress enacted § 1983 pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment, which targets state action. But when it said "every person" could be sued, it did not mean states — because the general rule of statutory construction is that "person" does not include the sovereign unless the statute expressly says so. Nothing in § 1983's text or legislative history indicated Congress intended to override state sovereign immunity.

2. **Eleventh Amendment**: A damages suit against a state official in their official capacity is the "functional equivalent of a suit against the State itself" (citing [_Kentucky v. Graham_](/cases/kentucky-v-graham)). Because the state is not a "person" under § 1983, its officials acting in official capacity are not either.

**Critical caveat**: The Court expressly left open that state officials can be sued in their **individual capacity** under § 1983, and that official-capacity suits for **injunctive relief** remain viable under _Ex parte Young_.

## What It Means in Practice

_Will_ creates a fundamental boundary in § 1983 litigation:

| Defendant                            | § 1983 Damages            | § 1983 Injunction     |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Municipality (city/county)           | ✅ (_Monell_)             | ✅                    |
| State government                     | ❌ (_Will_)               | ❌                    |
| State official – official capacity   | ❌ (_Will_)               | ✅ (_Ex parte Young_) |
| State official – individual capacity | ✅                        | ✅                    |
| Local official – official capacity   | ✅ (= suing municipality) | ✅                    |
| Local official – individual capacity | ✅                        | ✅                    |

For § 1983 plaintiffs, the practical implications are stark:

- **Never sue a state or state agency for damages under § 1983** — it will be dismissed
- **State officials (troopers, state prison guards, university police)** can only be sued for damages in their **individual capacity**
- **Official-capacity injunctive relief** (like "stop doing this") is still available against state officials under _Ex parte Young_
- **Municipalities and local officials** are not affected — cities, counties, and sheriffs' offices remain suable under _Monell_

## How You Can Use It

- **Know the boundary**: If your claim involves state actors (state troopers, state agency employees, state university officials), sue them in their **individual capacity** for damages and in their **official capacity** only for injunctive relief.
- **Distinguish local from state**: Sheriffs, police departments, and city officers are _local_ officials suable under _Monell_. State highway patrol, state prison guards, and state agency employees fall under _Will_.
- **Template**: "Plaintiff sues [State Official] in [his/her] individual capacity for money damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiff does not seek damages from the State of [State] or from [Official] in [his/her] official capacity, consistent with _Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police_, 491 U.S. 58 (1989)."
- **Injunctive relief**: If you need the state to change a policy, sue a state official in official capacity for prospective injunctive relief under _Ex parte Young_, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).

## How It Can Be Used Against You

- **Dismissal of state defendants**: If you name a state or state agency as a defendant for damages, the claim will be dismissed outright. The same applies to state officials sued in their official capacity for damages.
- **"Official capacity by default"**: Some courts construe ambiguous complaints as official-capacity suits, which would be barred against state actors. The defense will argue your complaint fails to specify individual capacity.
- **No respondeat superior against the state**: Even if a state employee violated your rights, the state is not liable. There is no _Monell_-style liability for states.

**How to counter**: Be explicit in your complaint. State "individual capacity" clearly for every state official you name. If you need injunctive relief against a state, use _Ex parte Young_ and name the specific official responsible for enforcement. For damages, focus on the individual officer and any municipal defendants.
