## What This Case Is About

Lewis Anderson, an employee of the Pasadena Independent School District (PISD), sued the district and individual school board members under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) after he was subjected to adverse employment actions for opposing a school bond election and an administrative reorganization. The case addresses when public employees' speech is protected under the First Amendment and when school officials can claim [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) for retaliatory employment decisions.

## The Facts

Anderson worked for PISD and publicly opposed a school bond election and an administrative reorganization that the school board supported. He also exercised his right to freedom of association by joining with others who shared his views.

After Anderson voiced his opposition, the school board and Superintendent Frederick Schneider took adverse employment actions against him. Anderson alleged these actions were motivated by retaliation for his protected speech and associational activities.

Anderson filed suit on November 6, 1995, under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983), naming PISD, Superintendent Schneider, and seven school board members as defendants. He alleged violations of his free speech rights and asserted state law claims as well.

The individual defendants moved to dismiss on the basis of qualified immunity and sought to halt discovery until the immunity question was resolved. The district court ordered Anderson to replead with particularity, and he filed a Second Amended Complaint adding claims for violations of his rights to freedom of association and due process. The individual defendants again moved to dismiss.

## What the Court Decided

The Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part. The court's analysis centered on the _Pickering-Connick_ framework for evaluating public-employee speech claims.

Under this framework, a court must first determine whether the employee spoke on a matter of "public concern." Anderson's opposition to a school bond election and administrative reorganization clearly qualified—these were matters of significant public interest affecting taxpayers and the community, not merely internal workplace grievances.

Next, the court balanced the employee's free speech interest against the employer's interest in efficient operations. The court found that Anderson's speech did not disrupt the workplace to a degree that would justify the retaliatory actions taken against him.

On the heightened pleading requirement, the court held that Anderson had pleaded with sufficient particularity to survive dismissal. Anderson alleged that the board members and superintendent made specifically enumerated decisions that adversely impacted his employment, and though they acted in closed meetings, he sought to hold each defendant responsible for their own actions, not for acts of subordinates.

The court affirmed the dismissal of Anderson's due process claims, finding no constitutionally protected property interest in the non-economic benefits of his position, consistent with the analysis in _Kinsey v. Salado Independent School District_.

In a consolidated appeal, the defendants challenged monetary sanctions related to an improper removal to federal court, which the court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

**Public-concern speech is strongly protected.** When a government employee speaks on matters of public interest—like opposing a bond election, criticizing government spending, or challenging policy decisions—that speech is protected by the First Amendment. Employers cannot retaliate.

**The Pickering-Connick balancing test applies.** Courts weigh the employee's free speech interest against the government's interest in workplace efficiency. Speech on matters of broad public concern typically receives strong protection.

**Individual defendants must be personally connected.** To state a claim under § 1983, a plaintiff must identify defendants who were either personally involved in the constitutional violation or whose acts are causally connected to it. Holding officials liable for acts of subordinates with whom they had no involvement is insufficient.

**Plead with particularity.** The court required Anderson to replead his claims with specificity to overcome qualified immunity. This is a common procedural hurdle in § 1983 cases—vague allegations will not survive a motion to dismiss.

## Key Takeaway

Government employees who speak out on matters of public concern—such as opposing a bond election or criticizing administrative decisions—are protected from retaliation under the First Amendment. However, whether the employer's interest in efficient operations outweighs the employee's speech interest requires a fact-intensive Pickering balancing analysis that generally cannot be resolved at the motion-to-dismiss stage without sufficient factual development.
