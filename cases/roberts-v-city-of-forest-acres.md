## What This Case Is About

John E. Roberts was stopped by Officer Daniel Jacko of the City of Forest Acres Police Department in Columbia, South Carolina. During the encounter, Officer Jacko used force that Roberts alleged was grossly disproportionate to any threat Roberts posed. Roberts filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against both Officer Jacko individually and the City of Forest Acres, claiming excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment and arguing that the city was liable under _Monell v. Department of Social Services_ for inadequate training and supervision.

## What the Court Decided

The federal district court in South Carolina denied summary judgment on both the individual excessive force claim against Officer Jacko and the municipal liability claim against the City of Forest Acres. The court applied the _Graham v. Connor_ objective reasonableness standard, examining the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect posed an immediate threat, and whether the suspect was actively resisting or attempting to evade arrest. The court found genuine issues of material fact existed regarding whether the force used was objectively reasonable under the circumstances. On the municipal liability claim, the court found sufficient evidence that the city's training and supervision practices could constitute deliberate indifference to the constitutional rights of citizens.

## Why This Case Matters for Pro Se Litigants

This South Carolina case demonstrates how excessive force claims survive summary judgment when there is a genuine factual dispute about whether the level of force was reasonable. It is a useful reference for anyone building a § 1983 case in South Carolina, as it applies the _Graham v. Connor_ factors in a straightforward traffic-stop context. It also shows how _Monell_ municipal liability works—a plaintiff can sue the city itself if they can show the city's policies, customs, or deliberate indifference to training caused the constitutional violation. For pro se litigants, this case illustrates that even at the summary judgment stage, if the facts are genuinely in dispute, the case should go to a jury.
