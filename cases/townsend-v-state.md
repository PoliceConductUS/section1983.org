## What This Case Is About

Townsend v. State is a Texas state criminal appeal involving a DWI conviction. While not a [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) case itself, Townsend is frequently cited in civil rights litigation for its discussion of the legal standards governing traffic stops—specifically, what constitutes [reasonable suspicion](/primer/reasonable-suspicion) to initiate a stop and when a driver's consent to testing is considered voluntary. These principles directly apply to Fourth Amendment challenges in § 1983 excessive force and false arrest cases.

## The Facts

In the early morning hours of September 7, 1989, Houston Police Officer Miles Scott observed the appellant's car traveling westbound in the 8300 block of Westheimer in Houston. Officer Scott testified that he saw the car weave from the center lane to the left lane and then across traffic to the far right lane. Based on this observed weaving, Officer Scott stopped the vehicle.

Upon approaching the car, the officer noticed that the driver smelled strongly of alcohol and had red, glassy eyes. The driver failed four field sobriety tests. Officer Scott arrested the driver for suspicion of driving while intoxicated and transported him to the Westside Police Station, where he was given an intoxilyzer test registering a .20 blood-alcohol concentration. He was also given a videotape skills test.

The defendant argued that his consent to the breath test was coerced because officers told him that refusing the test would result in being jailed, having his license suspended, and being charged with DWI. Officer Scott denied telling the defendant he would be arrested or jailed for refusing the test.

## What the Court Decided

The Texas Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction on all points. On the consent issue, the court held that the trial court, as the sole judge of the weight and credibility of witnesses, was free to believe Officer Scott's testimony and disbelieve the defendant's. The court emphasized that appellate courts must view evidence in the light most favorable to the trial court's ruling and will not disturb a ruling on the admissibility of evidence absent a clear abuse of discretion.

On the traffic stop itself, the court found that Officer Scott's observation of the car weaving between lanes provided sufficient justification for the stop. The court noted that Texas implied consent law deems anyone operating a motor vehicle on public highways to have consented to breath or blood testing, though such consent must still be voluntary.

The court also rejected the defendant's argument that the State was required to prove consent by "clear and convincing evidence," finding that the constitutional requirements for search of premises had not been extended to the implied consent law governing breath tests.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

**Weaving provides reasonable suspicion for a traffic stop.** An officer who observes a vehicle weaving between lanes has an objectively reasonable basis for initiating a traffic stop. This standard is frequently applied in [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment) challenges to the legality of traffic stops that lead to arrests and use of force.

**Consent findings are highly deferential.** Trial courts have broad discretion in determining whether a person's consent was voluntary. When conflicting testimony exists about what officers said, the trial court's resolution of credibility disputes is given great deference on appeal.

**Traffic stops are the gateway to many § 1983 claims.** Many civil rights cases begin with a traffic stop. Understanding when a stop is legally justified is critical because an unlawful stop can taint everything that follows—the arrest, the search, and any use of force.

## Key Takeaway

Townsend v. State establishes that observed traffic violations like weaving between lanes provide sufficient reasonable suspicion to justify a traffic stop, and that a trial court's determination that a driver voluntarily consented to testing will not be overturned absent a clear abuse of discretion. For § 1983 plaintiffs, this means that challenging the legality of a traffic stop requires strong evidence that the officer lacked any objective basis for the stop.
