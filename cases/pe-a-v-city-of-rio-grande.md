## What This Case Is About

_Peña v. City of Rio Grande City_ addresses the importance of allowing plaintiffs to amend their complaints to meet federal pleading standards, particularly when their [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force) claims involving a taser deployment are plausible. The Fifth Circuit vacated the dismissal and remanded for [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) analysis.

## The Facts

Police officers for the City of Rio Grande City intervened after observing an altercation between Maria Peña and her father near their family car. Officer Humberto Vela first tried to extract Peña from the back seat of the car. Peña fled, and Officer Rosa Salinas pursued on foot. At Lieutenant Jose Solis's order, Salinas fired her taser at Peña. The barbs attached to Peña's back and scalp. She fell to the ground, suffering injuries to her face and teeth.

Peña initially sued the city in state court, alleging negligence under the Texas Tort Claims Act. She later added [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) excessive force claims against the city, Salinas, and Solis. After removal to federal court, Peña twice sought leave to amend her complaint to satisfy federal pleading standards.

The district court denied Peña's motion for leave to amend, dismissed her claims against the officers, and entered judgment on the pleadings for the city — without considering her proposed amended complaint.

## What the Court Decided

The Fifth Circuit vacated and remanded in part, affirmed in part.

**The amended complaint should have been considered**: The district court erred by looking only at Peña's second motion to amend (which lacked the attached complaint) rather than her first motion (which included the proposed amended complaint). The court should have considered the substance of the proposed amendments.

**Plausible excessive force claims**: The proposed amended complaint stated plausible claims against the officers. The allegations — that officers tased a woman who was fleeing a family dispute, attaching barbs to her back and scalp and causing facial and dental injuries — were sufficient under [_Iqbal_](/primer/plausibility-pleading) to state a [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment) excessive force claim.

**Remand for qualified immunity**: Rather than resolving [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) on appeal, the court remanded for the district court to consider whether Peña's pleadings survived the officers' qualified immunity defense in the first instance.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

- **Amend your complaint to meet federal standards**: If your case is removed from state court, promptly move to amend your complaint to satisfy the higher federal [plausibility pleading](/primer/plausibility-pleading) standard. Include specific factual allegations.
- **Taser use can constitute excessive force**: Deploying a taser against a person who is fleeing but not posing an immediate violent threat raises serious [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment) concerns, especially when the resulting injuries are significant.
- **Attach your proposed amended complaint**: When moving for leave to amend, always attach the proposed amended complaint to every motion — don't assume the court will look back at earlier filings.
- **Fleeing from a domestic dispute is different from fleeing a violent crime**: The [Graham factors](/primer/graham-factors) weigh the severity of the crime at issue. When police intervene in a family argument — not a violent felony — the justification for using a taser diminishes.
- **Procedural errors can be corrected on appeal**: If the district court improperly refuses to consider your amended pleading, the Fifth Circuit will correct that error and give you another chance.

## Key Takeaway

When officers tase a person who is fleeing a non-violent situation and the taser causes significant injuries, the [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force) claim is plausible and should survive a [motion to dismiss](/primer/motion-to-dismiss). Always ensure your proposed amended complaint is properly attached to your motion and contains specific factual allegations about what each officer did and what injuries resulted.
