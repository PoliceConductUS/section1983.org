## What This Case Is About

Escalante v. Hammel is an excessive force case involving the repeated use of a Taser on a restrained individual. The case addresses whether officers are entitled to [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) when they deploy electronic control weapons against a person who is not actively resisting.

## The Facts

The plaintiff, Escalante, was involved in an encounter with law enforcement officers that escalated to the use of force. According to the complaint, after officers had restrained Escalante, they deployed a Taser on him multiple times despite the fact that he was not actively resisting and did not pose an immediate threat to the officers or others.

Escalante filed suit under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983), alleging that the officers' repeated use of the Taser constituted excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The officers moved for dismissal, asserting qualified immunity.

## What the Court Decided

The Fifth Circuit held that the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity at this stage of the proceedings.

Applying the [_Graham v. Connor_](/cases/graham-v-connor) framework, the court examined the severity of the crime, the immediate threat posed by the plaintiff, and whether the plaintiff was actively resisting. Taking the facts in the light most favorable to Escalante, the court found:

- **The use of a Taser on a restrained, non-resisting person is clearly excessive.** The Graham factors weighed heavily in the plaintiff's favor. Once a person is restrained and not resisting, officers have no justification for deploying painful electronic weapons.

- **The right to be free from force after resistance ceases was clearly established.** The Fifth Circuit's precedent has long recognized that force used after a suspect stops resisting can violate clearly established law. This principle extends to Taser deployments.

- **Multiple Taser applications compound the excessiveness.** Repeated Taser use against a non-resisting individual is even more clearly unreasonable than a single deployment.

The court denied qualified immunity and allowed the case to proceed to discovery and trial.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

Escalante v. Hammel reinforces critical principles about electronic control weapons:

- **Tasers are significant force.** Courts treat Taser deployments as a significant use of force, not a trivial measure. The pain and risk of injury from Taser use means officers must justify each deployment under the _Graham_ reasonableness standard.

- **Restraint changes the calculus.** Once a suspect is restrained — whether by handcuffs, body weight, or other means — the justification for additional force diminishes dramatically. Officers who continue to use force on restrained individuals act at their legal peril.

- **Repeated force multiplies the violation.** A single use of force might be debatable; repeated applications against a non-resisting person make the excessiveness far more obvious.

- **This principle is clearly established.** Officers cannot claim they didn't know it was wrong to Taser a restrained, non-resisting person. This is an "obvious case" where the general _Graham_ framework provides sufficient notice.

## Key Takeaway

If officers used a Taser on you after you were restrained and had stopped resisting, Escalante v. Hammel supports your excessive force claim. The use of electronic control weapons on non-resisting, restrained individuals is a clear constitutional violation for which qualified immunity will not protect the officers involved.
