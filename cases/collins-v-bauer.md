## What This Case Is About

Collins v. Bauer involves a motorcyclist who was chased, rammed, and allegedly beaten by Dallas police officers. The case tests the sufficiency of § 1983 excessive force and conspiracy claims at the motion-to-dismiss stage, with the court largely ruling in favor of the plaintiff.

## The Facts

On September 25, 2010, Dallas Police Officers Bauer and Randolph were in their patrol car when they spotted Andrew Collins on his motorcycle. Although Collins rode away when the officers activated their lights, a police sergeant ordered the officers not to pursue — and the city had a no-chase policy. The officers ignored both the order and the policy.

The officers chased Collins through residential streets and drove the wrong way on a service road. A dashboard camera recorded the officers' comments during the chase. Either Bauer or Randolph was heard saying: "Keep us going. I'm going to kick the [expletive] out of him."

The chase ended when the patrol car struck Collins's motorcycle. Although Collins immediately dropped to the ground and spread his arms and legs in surrender, he alleged that Bauer and Randolph began beating him. Collins also alleged that additional officers — Duetsch and John Does — arrived at the scene, witnessed the beating, and failed to intervene.

Collins filed suit under § 1983, asserting excessive force, conspiracy, assault and battery under state law, and bystander liability against the witnessing officers.

## What the Court Decided

The magistrate judge recommended denying the motions to dismiss and for judgment on the pleadings in most respects.

**Excessive force claims survived.** Collins alleged that he was spread-eagled and compliant when officers beat him. Under [_Graham v. Connor_](/cases/graham-v-connor), force against a non-resisting, compliant suspect is clearly excessive. The dashboard camera recording of the officers' stated intent to "kick the [expletive] out of him" strengthened the claim.

**Conspiracy claims survived.** The court found that Collins adequately alleged an agreement among the officers to use excessive force, supported by the recorded comments and the officers' joint actions in defying the no-chase order.

**Bystander liability claims survived.** Collins alleged that Officer Duetsch and the John Doe defendants observed the beating and had a reasonable opportunity to intervene but failed to do so. Under Fifth Circuit precedent, officers who witness excessive force and fail to intervene can be held liable under § 1983.

**Qualified immunity was not resolved at this stage.** The court found that at the motion-to-dismiss stage, the factual allegations, taken as true, described conduct that violated clearly established law.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

Collins v. Bauer illustrates several important principles:

- **Dashboard camera evidence is powerful.** Officers' own recorded statements can be devastating evidence of intent to use excessive force.

- **No-chase policies matter.** When officers violate their own department's no-chase policy, it can be evidence that their conduct was unreasonable.

- **Bystander officers can be liable.** Officers who stand by and watch while their colleagues use excessive force — without intervening — can be held liable under § 1983.

- **Conspiracy claims require an agreement.** But that agreement can be inferred from coordinated action and recorded statements.

- **Compliance defeats force.** When a suspect has surrendered and is lying prone and compliant, any use of significant force is clearly excessive.

## Key Takeaway

Collins v. Bauer shows that when officers announce their intent to beat a suspect, ignore orders not to chase, and then use force against a compliant, surrendering individual, all of the officers involved — including bystanders who fail to intervene — can be held liable under § 1983. Dashboard camera footage and recorded statements can be the most powerful evidence in an excessive force case.
