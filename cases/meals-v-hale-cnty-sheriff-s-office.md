## What This Case Is About

A pretrial detainee sued the Hale County Sheriff's Office under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983), alleging constitutional violations related to the conditions of his confinement. The court dismissed the claims because a sheriff's office is not a legal entity that can be sued under § 1983, and the plaintiff failed to allege sufficient facts to establish [Monell liability](/primer/monell-liability) against the county.

## The Facts

The plaintiff was held as a [pretrial detainee](/primer/pretrial-detention) in the Hale County jail. He alleged that conditions in the jail violated his constitutional rights — potentially including claims of [deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference) to his medical needs or unsafe conditions of confinement. He named the Hale County Sheriff's Office as the defendant.

## What the Court Decided

The court dismissed the case on multiple grounds.

First, the court held that the Hale County Sheriff's Office is not a legal entity capable of being sued under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983). In Texas, a sheriff's office or police department is generally not a "person" within the meaning of § 1983 — it is merely a department of the county government. The proper defendant for [municipal liability](/primer/municipal-liability) is the county itself (here, Hale County), not the sheriff's office.

Second, even if the court construed the complaint as naming the county, the plaintiff failed to allege facts sufficient to establish [Monell liability](/primer/monell-liability). The complaint did not identify a specific policy, custom, or [failure to train](/primer/failure-to-train) that caused the alleged constitutional violations. Conclusory allegations that conditions were unconstitutional, without tying those conditions to a specific municipal policy decision, are insufficient.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

_Meals v. Hale County Sheriff's Office_ addresses a common and easily avoidable mistake:

- **Name the right defendant**: In Texas (and most states), a sheriff's office or police department is not a separate legal entity that can be sued. Sue the **county** (or city) that operates the department. Getting this wrong can result in dismissal.
- **[Monell](/primer/monell-liability) requirements still apply**: Even when you name the correct municipal entity, you must identify a specific policy, custom, or training failure. The county is not automatically liable because a jail or sheriff's office violated your rights.
- **[Pretrial detainee](/primer/pretrial-detention) claims**: Pretrial detainees are protected by the [Fourteenth Amendment's](/primer/fourteenth-amendment) due process clause, not the Eighth Amendment. The standard is [deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference) to serious medical needs or unconstitutional conditions of confinement.
- **Practical tips**:
  - Always name the county or city as the defendant for [municipal liability](/primer/municipal-liability) — not the police department or sheriff's office
  - Identify the specific policy or custom you're challenging
  - If alleging [failure to train](/primer/failure-to-train), specify what training was missing and how it caused the violation
  - If [pro se](/primer/pro-se), research your state's law on which government entities are suable

## Key Takeaway

A sheriff's office is not a suable entity under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) in Texas — the proper defendant is the county — and even when the correct entity is named, you must plead specific facts establishing a [policy, custom, or training failure](/primer/monell-liability) that caused the constitutional violation, not just that conditions were bad.
