## What This Case Is About

_Pineda v. City of Houston_ illustrates the difficulty of holding a city liable under [_Monell_](/primer/monell-liability) even when police officers commit a clear constitutional violation — here, an unconstitutional warrantless entry followed by a fatal shooting. The Fifth Circuit affirmed summary judgment for the city because the plaintiffs could not link the officers' conduct to a city policy or custom.

## The Facts

On July 11, 1998, Houston police officers and members of the Southwest Gang Task Force stopped a car for a traffic violation. The driver, Ryan Baxter, volunteered information about his drug supplier, "Rogelio," in exchange for lenient treatment. Officers Pete Herrada and J.R. Willis contacted other task force members — Sergeant Darrell Strouse and officers David Perkins, Lamont Tillery, and David Barrera — and together they devised a plan to raid the drug supplier's residence.

The officers went to the home of Pedro Oregon Navarro. Without obtaining a [warrant](/primer/warrant-requirement), and without [exigent circumstances](/primer/exigent-circumstances), the officers entered the residence. During the warrantless entry, officers shot and killed Pedro Oregon Navarro.

His family sued the City of Houston under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983), alleging that the city's policies, training, and supervision of the gang task force led to the unconstitutional entry and fatal shooting. They also brought supplemental state law claims.

## What the Court Decided

The Fifth Circuit affirmed summary judgment for the City of Houston on the § 1983 claim.

**The constitutional violation was clear**: The court acknowledged that the warrantless entry into Navarro's home was unconstitutional — the officers had no warrant and no exigent circumstances justified the entry.

**But municipal liability requires more**: Under [_Monell_](/primer/monell-liability), the city is liable only if the violation resulted from an official policy or custom. The plaintiffs needed to show that the city had a policy authorizing warrantless entries, that a widespread practice of such entries existed, or that a [final policymaker](/primer/final-policymaker) sanctioned the conduct.

The plaintiffs' evidence fell short. They argued that the city's training and supervision of the gang task force were inadequate, but could not show that the city was on notice of prior similar incidents demonstrating [deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference). The officers' decision to enter without a warrant was their own — not the product of a city policy or custom.

**State claims dismissed without prejudice**: The court modified the district court's order to dismiss the supplemental state law claims _without_ prejudice rather than with prejudice, preserving the family's ability to refile in state court.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

- **A clear constitutional violation doesn't guarantee municipal liability**: Even when officers plainly violate the [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment), the city walks free unless you can connect the violation to a policy, practice, or custom.
- **[Failure to train](/primer/failure-to-train) claims need evidence of notice**: You must show the city knew its training was deficient — typically through evidence of prior similar incidents — and deliberately chose not to address it.
- **Gang task forces and specialized units are harder to attack**: Because these units often operate with greater autonomy, it can be harder to trace their decisions back to official city policy.
- **Preserve your state law claims**: If your federal claims against the city fail, make sure your state law claims are dismissed _without_ prejudice so you can refile in state court.
- **Always sue the individual officers**: The family's case against the city failed, but claims against the individual officers might have succeeded. Don't rely solely on [municipal liability](/primer/municipal-liability).

## Key Takeaway

Even when police officers commit a flagrant constitutional violation — entering a home without a warrant and killing an occupant — the city escapes [_Monell_](/primer/monell-liability) liability unless you can prove that a city policy, practice, or custom was the [moving force](/primer/moving-force-causation) behind the officers' decision. Always pair your municipal claim with individual-capacity claims against the officers themselves.
