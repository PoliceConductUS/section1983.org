## What Happened

In 1961, fifteen white and Black Episcopal clergymen set out on a "prayer pilgrimage" from New Orleans to Detroit to promote racial integration. Their letters show they planned to test their right to use segregated facilities at the Jackson, Mississippi bus terminal — and they fully expected to be arrested.

When the ministers arrived at the Jackson bus terminal, they entered the "White Waiting Room Only — By Order of the Police Department." They then tried to enter the small restaurant but were stopped by Officers Griffith and Nichols, who ordered them to "move on." The ministers replied that they wanted to eat and refused. Captain Ray arrived shortly after, and all the ministers were arrested and charged under Mississippi Code § 2087.5, which made it a misdemeanor to congregate in a public place under circumstances where a breach of peace might occur and refuse to move on when ordered by police.

The ministers waived a jury trial and were convicted by municipal police justice Spencer. They received the maximum sentence: four months in jail and a $200 fine. On appeal, one minister got a directed verdict in his favor, and the charges against the rest were dropped.

The ministers then sued the officers and the judge under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) for damages, also asserting common-law false arrest claims. At trial, the facts were sharply disputed. The ministers testified that there was no crowd and no threat of violence. The officers testified that 25 to 30 hostile bystanders followed the ministers inside. The jury found for all defendants — but the verdict was tainted by prejudicial cross-examination about the ministers' alleged ties to Communist views on racial justice.

Years later, in _Thomas v. Mississippi_ (1965), the Supreme Court held § 2087.5 unconstitutional as applied to similar facts. This meant the arrests in this case were made under an unconstitutional statute.

## What the Court Decided

Chief Justice Warren delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court on two key holdings.

**First**, the Court held that judges are absolutely immune from § 1983 liability for their judicial acts. Judge Spencer couldn't be sued for convicting the ministers, even if the conviction was unconstitutional. This immunity was a well-established common-law doctrine, and the Court held that Congress did not abolish it when it enacted § 1983. Justice Douglas dissented vigorously on this point, arguing that "every person" means every person — including judges who knowingly deprive people of their civil rights.

**Second** — and this is the holding that created [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) — the Court held that "the defense of good faith and probable cause, which the Court of Appeals found available to the officers in the common-law action for false arrest and imprisonment, is also available to them in the action under § 1983." 386 U.S. at 557. The officers could not be expected to "predict the future course of constitutional law" — they weren't liable for arresting people under a statute they reasonably believed was valid.

The Court read § 1983 "against the background of tort liability that makes a man responsible for the natural consequences of his actions." 386 U.S. at 556 (quoting _Monroe v. Pape_). Since the common law of false arrest included a defense for officers who acted with good faith and probable cause, that defense carried over to § 1983.

But the Court didn't dismiss the case outright. The evidence about whether the officers actually acted in good faith was disputed. The ministers claimed they were arrested solely for trying to use the waiting room, not because of any threat of violence. A new trial was needed.

## What It Means in Practice

_Pierson v. Ray_ planted the seed that grew into the qualified immunity doctrine. The "good faith and probable cause" defense recognized here was later transformed by _Harlow v. Fitzgerald_ (1982) into the purely objective "clearly established law" standard that dominates § 1983 litigation today. Understanding _Pierson_ is essential for understanding where qualified immunity came from — and for arguing where it should go.

The original _Pierson_ defense was subjective: did the officer actually believe, in good faith, that their conduct was lawful? Fifteen years later, _Harlow_ stripped out the subjective element, holding that an officer is immune as long as their conduct doesn't violate "clearly established" rights — regardless of their actual intentions. This evolution dramatically expanded the doctrine's protective reach.

_Pierson_ also cemented judicial immunity, shielding judges from § 1983 suits for their courtroom decisions. This remains the law today.

## How You Can Use It

_Pierson_ is mostly used by defendants, but it has value for plaintiffs too:

- **The original defense was narrower.** _Pierson_'s "good faith and probable cause" test was more favorable to plaintiffs than modern qualified immunity. When arguing for QI reform or narrowing, cite _Pierson_ to show how far the doctrine has drifted from its origins.
- **Good faith was originally a factual question.** Under _Pierson_, a jury decided whether the officer actually acted in good faith. Today, qualified immunity is almost always decided by judges as a matter of law. This shift has eliminated the jury's role in assessing officer conduct.
- **The ministers didn't "consent."** The Court rejected the argument that the ministers consented to their arrest by deliberately exercising their rights. "The deliberate exercise of [a constitutional] right in a peaceful, orderly, and inoffensive manner does not disqualify them from seeking damages under § 1983." 386 U.S. at 558. This is directly relevant when defendants argue that a plaintiff "provoked" the encounter.

## How It Can Be Used Against You

_Pierson_ is the foundation on which qualified immunity rests:

- **Officers can't predict constitutional rulings.** The core holding — that officers shouldn't be punished for enforcing laws they reasonably believed were valid — is the essence of QI. Defendants will cite _Pierson_ for the principle that officers deserve protection from liability when the law is uncertain.
- **Common-law backdrop.** The Court's reliance on common-law defenses provides textual support for QI as an inherent feature of § 1983, not a judicial invention.
- **Judicial immunity is absolute.** If your case involves a judge — for example, a magistrate who set unconstitutional bail conditions or a judge who participated in a pattern of discriminatory sentencing — _Pierson_ bars damages claims for judicial acts.

**How to counter**: Emphasize that _Pierson_'s original formulation was a subjective good-faith defense that went to the jury — nothing like the sweeping, judge-decided "clearly established law" doctrine that exists today. If the officer's conduct was egregious, argue that no reasonable officer could have believed it was lawful, which defeats QI under any formulation. And remember that _Pierson_ itself sent the case back for a new trial because the evidence of good faith was disputed — the defense was never meant to be an automatic get-out-of-liability card.
