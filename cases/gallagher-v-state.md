## What This Case Is About

_Gallagher v. State_ is a Texas state criminal case addressing when police have [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause) to make a warrantless arrest for public intoxication. While not a [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) case itself, it is relevant to civil rights litigation because it establishes the circumstances under which an officer's arrest for public intoxication is supported by probable cause — the absence of which is the foundation of a [false arrest](/primer/false-arrest) claim.

## The Facts

Robert Michael Gallagher and a friend entered Gaido's Restaurant in the late afternoon of November 19, 1987. The assistant manager, Donald Rouse, seated them but told them the restaurant would not serve them alcohol because they were intoxicated. Gallagher dropped his napkin, spent considerable time under the table looking for it, dropped it again, and then disturbed customers at the next table. Rouse asked them to leave.

As the two left, Rouse noticed they were in such bad condition they needed help. He offered to call a cab. Gallagher initially agreed, then said he needed to go "upstairs" to get his clothes — the restaurant had no second floor. The two stumbled to their car. Gallagher's companion got on his knees trying to get the key in the lock, failed, and handed the keys to Gallagher, who also got on his knees to eye the keyhole but fell backwards. They eventually got in the car, with Gallagher in the passenger seat, and drove away.

Rouse called the police. Officer Torres received the dispatch, located the vehicle a few blocks from the restaurant, and pulled them over. When Gallagher stepped out of the car, he staggered and braced himself against the side of the vehicle. Torres arrested him for public intoxication, conducted a pat-down search, and found two tablets of methaqualone in his coat pocket.

## What the Court Decided

The Texas Court of Appeals affirmed Gallagher's conviction. The key issue was whether the officer had probable cause for the arrest. Under Texas law, a person commits public intoxication by appearing in a public place under the influence of alcohol to the degree that they may endanger themselves or others. The danger need not be immediate — it is sufficient if the person renders themselves or others "subject to potential danger."

The court found that Officer Torres had probable cause based on the combination of Rouse's detailed report (Rouse was a reliable citizen informant, not an anonymous tipster) and Torres's own observations of Gallagher's visible intoxication. A reasonably prudent person, seeing Gallagher in his intoxicated state near a car on a busy boulevard, could conclude he was a danger to himself and others.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

If you were arrested for public intoxication and are considering a [false arrest](/primer/false-arrest) claim under § 1983, _Gallagher_ illustrates how broadly Texas courts interpret the "danger to self or others" element. Courts have found this element satisfied even when the suspect was merely near a vehicle while intoxicated — not actually driving. This makes public intoxication arrests difficult to challenge on probable cause grounds.

However, the case also shows the importance of reliable informant information. The officer here had specific, detailed information from an identified citizen who personally witnessed Gallagher's condition. An arrest based on a vague anonymous tip, without the officer's own corroborating observations, would stand on weaker footing.

## Key Takeaway

Texas courts interpret public intoxication probable cause broadly — being visibly intoxicated near a vehicle on a public road can be enough, even if the suspect was a passenger. For [false arrest](/primer/false-arrest) claims, this means challenging public intoxication arrests requires showing either that the person was not actually intoxicated or that they posed no plausible danger. The combination of a reliable citizen report plus the officer's own observations creates strong probable cause that is difficult to overcome.
