## What This Case Is About

_New York Times Co. v. Sullivan_ is a landmark First Amendment case that established the "actual malice" standard for defamation claims by public officials. While primarily a libel case, it is foundational to [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) litigation because it protects citizens' right to criticize government officials and reinforces the constitutional principles underlying [First Amendment retaliation](/primer/first-amendment-retaliation) claims.

## The Facts

In 1960, the New York Times published a full-page advertisement titled "Heed Their Rising Voices," placed by civil rights supporters. The ad described police actions against civil rights protesters in Montgomery, Alabama, and solicited funds for the movement. It contained several minor factual inaccuracies — for example, it stated that students sang "My Country, 'Tis of Thee" on the state capitol steps when they had actually sung the National Anthem, and it misstated the number of times Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had been arrested.

L.B. Sullivan, the Montgomery City Commissioner who supervised the police department, sued for libel. Although he was never mentioned by name in the advertisement, he argued that references to "police" constituted defamation of him personally. An Alabama jury awarded Sullivan $500,000 — and similar suits by other officials threatened millions more in damages, creating a chilling effect on civil rights coverage.

## What the Court Decided

The Supreme Court unanimously reversed, establishing a constitutional standard that public officials must meet to recover damages for defamation related to their official conduct. Justice Brennan wrote:

**The actual malice standard**: A public official cannot recover damages for a defamatory falsehood relating to official conduct unless the official proves the statement was made "with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not." Minor factual errors in political speech are constitutionally protected.

**Debate on public issues must be robust**: The Court grounded its decision in "a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials."

**The Sedition Act parallel**: The Court connected Alabama's defamation law to the discredited Sedition Act of 1798, which had made it a crime to criticize the government. The Court declared that the "attack upon its validity has carried the day in the court of history."

Justice Goldberg, joined by Justice Douglas, concurred but went further, arguing that the Constitution affords citizens an _absolute_ privilege to criticize official conduct — not merely a conditional one requiring proof of actual malice.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

- **Foundation for First Amendment retaliation claims**: _Sullivan_ establishes that criticism of government officials is constitutionally protected. When police arrest or retaliate against you for criticizing them, this case is the bedrock principle supporting your [First Amendment retaliation](/primer/first-amendment-retaliation) claim.
- **Officers cannot use defamation suits to silence critics**: If officers or officials sue you for criticizing their conduct, _Sullivan_ requires them to prove actual malice — a very high bar that protects your right to speak out about police misconduct.
- **Factual errors don't forfeit protection**: Minor inaccuracies in your criticism of police conduct do not remove First Amendment protection. The speech must be knowingly false or made with reckless disregard for truth to lose its constitutional shield.
- **"Breathing space" for civil rights speech**: The Court recognized that constitutional freedoms need "breathing space to survive" — the same principle that should protect your right to record police, file complaints, and publicly advocate for accountability.
- **Counter retaliatory defamation suits**: If officials threaten or file defamation claims against you for publicizing their misconduct, _Sullivan_ is your primary defense.

## Key Takeaway

The First Amendment protects robust criticism of government officials, including police officers, even when that criticism contains minor factual errors. A public official can recover defamation damages only by proving "actual malice" — that the speaker knew the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for its truth. This principle undergirds every [First Amendment retaliation](/primer/first-amendment-retaliation) claim in [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) litigation.
