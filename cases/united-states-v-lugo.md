## What This Case Is About

United States v. Lugo is a federal criminal case addressing the constitutionality of interrogation practices used by Border Patrol agents in the BORCAP (Border Patrol Criminal Alien Program) program. While not a [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) case, Lugo is relevant to civil rights litigation because it examines important [Fifth Amendment](/primer/fifth-amendment) issues—specifically, when Miranda warnings are required, what constitutes a valid waiver of the right to counsel, and what happens when a suspect invokes and then allegedly waives that right. These issues frequently arise in § 1983 cases involving coerced confessions and custodial interrogation.

## The Facts

Rafael Nambo Lugo was serving time in the Cameron County Jail on a state offense when, as part of the routine BORCAP program, he was interviewed by a Border Patrol agent. Under BORCAP, agents routinely visit local jails, line up inmates, and ask each one a series of questions including name, date of birth, citizenship, and alien status. Individuals determined to be in the United States illegally have a detainer placed on them.

Based on his answers, a detainer was placed on Lugo. When released from jail, he was transported to the Border Patrol station for processing. At the station, agents read Lugo his Miranda rights in Spanish and provided a written copy. At 3:00 PM, Lugo signed a waiver of his right to an attorney. He subsequently admitted to entering the United States illegally by swimming the Rio Grande River. At some point, the interview was terminated when Lugo asked for an attorney.

Lugo's defense centered on the timing of events. He claimed he had asserted his right to an attorney immediately after being read his rights and before signing the waiver. He further claimed he signed the waiver only because he felt compelled to do so and did not understand what he was signing.

## What the Court Decided

The court denied the motion to suppress and found Lugo guilty.

On the Miranda issue, the court found that the agents properly administered Miranda warnings in Spanish and that Lugo's waiver was knowing and voluntary. The court credited the agents' testimony that Lugo signed the waiver before making any incriminating statements and that he only invoked his right to counsel later, at which point the interview was terminated.

The court addressed the BORCAP program's routine questioning at jails, distinguishing between the initial screening questions (name, citizenship, alien status) and the subsequent custodial interrogation at the Border Patrol station. The court found that the initial jail screening did not require Miranda warnings because the questions were routine booking-type inquiries, but that the subsequent interview at the station did require Miranda—which was properly administered.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

**Miranda violations can support § 1983 claims.** While the exclusionary rule prevents use of un-Mirandized statements in criminal court, a pattern of deliberately ignoring Miranda requirements can support a § 1983 claim, particularly in failure-to-train cases against municipalities.

**Routine booking questions are exempt from Miranda.** Standard biographical questions during booking—name, date of birth, address—do not require Miranda warnings. This distinction matters in § 1983 cases where plaintiffs allege their statements were coerced.

**Waiver must be knowing and voluntary.** For a waiver of Miranda rights to be valid, the person must understand their rights and voluntarily choose to waive them. Language barriers, mental health issues, or coercive circumstances can undermine the validity of a waiver.

**Invocation of counsel must be clear.** Once a suspect clearly invokes the right to counsel, interrogation must stop. Continuing to question a suspect after invocation can violate the Fifth Amendment and may support a § 1983 claim.

## Key Takeaway

Lugo demonstrates the importance of the timing and clarity of Miranda warnings and waivers in custodial settings. For § 1983 plaintiffs alleging coerced confessions or Miranda violations, the case illustrates that courts will closely examine whether warnings were given, whether the waiver was voluntary, and whether officers honored the suspect's invocation of the right to counsel. The credibility of conflicting accounts—the officer's versus the suspect's—is resolved by the trial court as factfinder.
