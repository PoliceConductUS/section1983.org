## What This Case Is About

Melinda Petta was convicted of fleeing a police officer after Trooper Adrian Rivera pulled her over for speeding, and the encounter escalated dramatically—Rivera allegedly beat her window with a nightstick, aimed his handgun at her, threatened to kill her, and shot at her tires during a pursuit. Petta then sued Rivera and the Texas Department of Public Safety. The Texas Supreme Court held that collateral estoppel barred her civil claims because the criminal jury necessarily rejected her claim that Rivera's force was disproportionate.

## The Facts

In 1990, Trooper Rivera stopped Petta for speeding while she was driving with her two children. An argument ensued about the speed and her unrestrained three-year-old. When Rivera returned to his patrol car, Petta locked her doors and rolled up her windows. According to Petta, Rivera then began beating her window with his nightstick, threatening to break the glass, and yelling obscenities. He blocked her car with his cruiser, and when she tried to leave, he allegedly aimed his handgun at her and threatened to kill her.

Petta fled, and Rivera pursued. During the chase, Rivera shot at her tires more than once and aimed his shotgun at her while driving—a civilian ride-along observer took the shotgun away. Several officers captured Petta when the chase ended at her home.

Petta was convicted of fleeing a police officer. In the criminal trial, she raised a defense of necessity—arguing Rivera's actions created imminent harm justifying her flight. The jury convicted her, necessarily finding beyond a reasonable doubt that she did not reasonably believe she faced imminent harm.

## What the Court Decided

The Texas Supreme Court held:

**Collateral estoppel against Rivera**: The criminal jury's finding that Petta did not reasonably believe she faced imminent harm from Rivera's actions was identical to the factual issue underlying Rivera's civil privilege defense—that his force was proportionate to the situation. Because both turned on the same objective reasonableness standard, Petta could not relitigate this issue.

**Sovereign immunity against DPS**: Petta's claims arose from intentional conduct (beating the window, pointing guns, shooting at tires), which falls squarely within the Texas Tort Claims Act's exclusion of claims arising from assault, battery, and false imprisonment. Her negligent training claim also failed because instructional manuals and training information are not "tangible personal property" under the Act.

**§ 1983 claims**: Neither the Department nor Rivera in his [official capacity](/primer/official-capacity) is a "person" subject to § 1983. Citing [Will v. Michigan Department of State Police](/cases/will-v-michigan-department-of-state-police), the court held that a § 1983 suit against a state official in his official capacity is a suit against the state, which is not a "person" under the statute.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

**Criminal convictions can estop civil claims.** If you are convicted of a crime arising from the same incident—particularly if your defense required proving the officers' conduct was unreasonable—collateral estoppel may bar your civil claims based on the same factual issue.

**Official capacity suits against state officials are suits against the state.** Under [Will v. Michigan](/cases/will-v-michigan-department-of-state-police), you cannot sue a state employee in their official capacity under § 1983 because the state is not a "person" under the statute. You must sue officers in their [individual capacity](/primer/individual-capacity) instead.

**Intentional torts are excluded from the Tort Claims Act.** Texas [sovereign immunity](/primer/sovereign-immunity) is not waived for claims arising from assault, battery, or false imprisonment—even if framed as negligent training or supervision.

## Key Takeaway

If you are convicted of fleeing or resisting police, and your defense was that the officers' force justified your flight, the criminal jury's rejection of that defense may collaterally estop you from later arguing in a civil case that the officers' force was excessive. This case underscores the critical interplay between criminal proceedings and subsequent civil rights litigation—and the importance of considering how a criminal conviction may impact your ability to bring a § 1983 claim.
