## What This Case Is About

_Stone v. Powell_ is a landmark Supreme Court decision that significantly limited the availability of federal habeas corpus relief for state prisoners claiming Fourth Amendment violations. The Court held that when a state court has provided a full and fair opportunity to litigate a [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment) claim, the prisoner cannot relitigate that claim in federal habeas proceedings.

## The Facts

The case consolidated two separate habeas corpus petitions. In both cases, state prisoners had been convicted with the aid of evidence they claimed was obtained through unconstitutional searches. Both prisoners had raised their Fourth Amendment claims in state courts and lost. They then sought federal habeas corpus relief, arguing the evidence should have been excluded under the exclusionary rule.

The federal courts of appeals had granted relief in both cases, applying the then-prevailing rule that Fourth Amendment claims were fully cognizable on federal habeas review.

## What the Court Decided

The Supreme Court reversed, holding that "where the State has provided an opportunity for full and fair litigation of a Fourth Amendment claim, a state prisoner may not be granted federal habeas corpus relief on the ground that evidence obtained in an unconstitutional search or seizure was introduced at his trial."

The Court's reasoning rested on a cost-benefit analysis of the exclusionary rule. The primary justification for the exclusionary rule is deterrence of unconstitutional police conduct. The Court concluded that the additional deterrent effect of allowing relitigation of Fourth Amendment claims on federal habeas was minimal compared to the significant costs: diversion of judicial resources, undermining the finality of state criminal judgments, and excluding reliable, probative evidence.

Justice Brennan dissented sharply, arguing the decision stripped federal courts of their role in ensuring state compliance with the Fourth Amendment and that Congress, not the Court, had the authority to limit habeas jurisdiction.

Justice White also dissented, warning that the ruling could lead to unequal treatment of similarly situated prisoners and expressing willingness to modify the exclusionary rule through a good-faith exception rather than limiting habeas jurisdiction.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

**Fourth Amendment claims have limited federal review.** If your Fourth Amendment claims were litigated in state court and you had a full and fair opportunity to raise them, you generally cannot relitigate them in federal habeas proceedings. This makes it critical to fully develop your Fourth Amendment arguments in state court.

**§ 1983 provides an alternative avenue.** While _Stone v. Powell_ limits habeas relief for search-and-seizure claims, it does not limit [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) civil rights lawsuits. You can bring a § 1983 action for damages based on unconstitutional searches and seizures regardless of whether you had a full and fair opportunity to litigate in state court.

**State court proceedings matter.** This case underscores the importance of vigorously litigating Fourth Amendment issues at the state level. If you fail to raise or adequately develop these claims in state court, you may lose the ability to raise them later.

## Key Takeaway

If you are a state prisoner whose conviction rested on evidence obtained through an allegedly unconstitutional search, federal habeas corpus is likely unavailable to challenge the admission of that evidence—as long as the state courts gave you a fair opportunity to litigate the issue. However, a § 1983 civil rights action for damages arising from the unconstitutional search itself remains available as a separate remedy. This case highlights the distinct roles of habeas corpus (challenging convictions) and § 1983 (seeking damages for constitutional violations).
