## What This Case Is About

This § 1983 action against the City of Irving, Texas involved claims of [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force) by Irving police officers. The case applies the standard framework from [_Graham v. Connor_](/cases/graham-v-connor) for evaluating excessive force and the [_Monell_](/cases/monell-v-dep-t-of-soc-servs) framework for [municipal liability](/primer/municipal-liability). The court analyzed whether the plaintiff could establish both an individual constitutional violation and the necessary policy or custom for holding the city liable.

## The Facts

The plaintiff brought a [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) action against the City of Irving alleging that officers used [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force) during an encounter. The plaintiff claimed that the force used during the incident was clearly excessive to the need and objectively unreasonable under the [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment). In addition to the individual force claims, the plaintiff alleged that the City of Irving was liable because its policies, customs, or practices regarding the use of force caused or contributed to the constitutional violation.

The City moved for [summary judgment](/primer/summary-judgment), arguing that the individual officers' conduct was objectively reasonable and that even if it were not, the city had no policy or [custom](/primer/custom) that was the [moving force](/primer/moving-force-causation) behind any constitutional violation.

## What the Court Decided

The court applied the Fifth Circuit's three-part test for excessive force claims: the plaintiff must show (1) a significant injury, (2) which resulted directly and only from the use of force that was clearly excessive to the need, and (3) the excessiveness of which was objectively unreasonable. This framework derives from [_Graham v. Connor_](/cases/graham-v-connor) and its Fifth Circuit progeny.

On the [municipal liability](/primer/municipal-liability) claim against the City of Irving, the court required the plaintiff to identify a specific official policy or entrenched custom that was the moving force behind the alleged constitutional violation. Under [_Monell_](/cases/monell-v-dep-t-of-soc-servs), a city cannot be held liable under § 1983 on a [respondeat superior](/primer/respondeat-superior) theory — the plaintiff must show that the city itself, through its policies or customs, caused the constitutional injury.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

This case demonstrates the standard application of excessive force and municipal liability frameworks in a North Texas § 1983 action. It reinforces that both elements must be independently established: you need to prove the individual officer violated your rights, and you separately need to prove that a city policy or custom was the moving force.

The case is also a reminder that the [_Graham v. Connor_](/cases/graham-v-connor) factors — severity of the crime, immediate threat, and active resistance — control the excessive force analysis. These factors must be evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, not with hindsight.

## Key Takeaway

To succeed in a § 1983 [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force) case against both an officer and a city, you must establish two independent things: (1) the officer's force was objectively unreasonable under the [_Graham_](/cases/graham-v-connor) factors, and (2) a city [policy or custom](/primer/monell-liability) was the [moving force](/primer/moving-force-causation) behind the violation. Winning on one element does not automatically give you the other — and failing on either defeats the corresponding claim.
