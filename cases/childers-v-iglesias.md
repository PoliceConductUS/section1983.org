## What This Case Is About

Childers v. Iglesias examines whether a rancher who was arrested for interfering with police officers' duties can maintain a § 1983 false arrest claim. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal, finding that the plaintiff's own allegations established that the officers had probable cause for the arrest.

## The Facts

Randy Childers owned a ranch in Parker County, Texas. On September 15, 2013, he went to his ranch to evict someone he had been allowing to stay there. He called the Parker County Sheriff's Office for assistance.

When Deputies Iglesias and Hollis arrived, Childers's truck was parked in front of the ranch gate. The deputies parked their car in front of Childers's truck. Childers claimed he was intending to leave but the deputies' car blocked him.

Childers attempted to explain the situation to Deputy Hollis. While he was talking to Hollis, Deputy Iglesias asked Childers to move his truck. Childers did not immediately comply, instead continuing to explain. Iglesias then arrested Childers for interfering with police duties.

Childers alleged that the deputies could have simply driven around his truck, and that Hollis agreed. Iglesias, however, did not believe he could drive around the truck. The district attorney eventually dismissed the charge, but Childers had been held in jail for over twenty-four hours and incurred legal fees.

Childers sued under § 1983, claiming the arrest violated the Fourth Amendment.

## What the Court Decided

The Fifth Circuit affirmed the dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6).

The court found that Childers's own allegations established that the deputies had probable cause for the arrest. By Childers's own account, he refused to comply with an officer's instruction to move his truck while the officers were responding to his own call for assistance. Under Texas law, interfering with an officer's duties can constitute a criminal offense. The fact that Childers thought the officers could have driven around his truck does not negate probable cause — it is enough that an officer could reasonably conclude that Childers was interfering.

The court applied the [_Twombly_](/cases/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly)/[_Iqbal_](/cases/ashcroft-v-iqbal) pleading standard and found that the facts as alleged did not state a claim for a constitutional violation. Because no constitutional violation was established, the [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) defense was easily satisfied.

The court also noted that the subsequent dismissal of the criminal charge by the district attorney does not retroactively negate probable cause. Probable cause is assessed based on what the officer knew at the time of the arrest.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

Childers v. Iglesias teaches important lessons about false arrest claims:

- **Your own allegations can defeat your claim.** If the facts you allege in your complaint actually support a finding of probable cause, your case will be dismissed at the pleading stage. Be careful how you frame the facts.

- **Probable cause requires only a reasonable basis.** Officers do not need to have the best or only reasonable interpretation of events. If a reasonable officer could conclude a crime occurred, probable cause exists.

- **Dropped charges do not equal false arrest.** The fact that a prosecutor later drops charges does not mean the arrest lacked probable cause. Probable cause is evaluated at the time of arrest.

- **Minor non-compliance can create probable cause.** Refusing to follow a lawful order — even briefly — may provide sufficient basis for an arrest, particularly for offenses like interfering with police duties.

## Key Takeaway

Childers v. Iglesias is a cautionary tale: if your own description of events shows that you refused to comply with a police instruction during an active call for service, a court may find that the officers had probable cause for your arrest. The later dismissal of charges does not change that analysis. Craft your complaint carefully to highlight facts that undermine probable cause, rather than facts that support it.
