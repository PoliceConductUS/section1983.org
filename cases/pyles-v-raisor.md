## What This Case Is About

Teresa Pyles brought a § 1983 action against two Kentucky police officers, Robert S. Raisor and Ray L. Sabbatine, alleging they used excessive force during her arrest in Mt. Sterling, Kentucky. Pyles claimed the officers used physical force far beyond what was necessary to effect the arrest, causing her significant injury. The officers moved for summary judgment based on qualified immunity, arguing their actions were objectively reasonable.

## What the Court Decided

The Sixth Circuit reversed the district court's grant of qualified immunity to the officers, holding that the right to be free from gratuitous violence during an arrest was clearly established at the time of the incident. Applying the _Graham v. Connor_ framework, the court examined the totality of the circumstances—including the severity of the alleged crime, whether the suspect posed an immediate threat to the safety of officers or others, and whether the suspect was actively resisting arrest. The court found that genuine disputes of material fact existed about whether the force used was objectively reasonable, and that at the summary judgment stage, these disputes must be resolved in favor of the non-moving party.

## Why This Case Matters for Pro Se Litigants

This Sixth Circuit case from Kentucky is significant for anyone who was beaten during an arrest and wants to overcome a qualified immunity defense. The court confirmed that officers cannot claim qualified immunity when their use of force is clearly disproportionate to the situation, because the right to be free from gratuitous physical violence during an arrest has been clearly established for decades. For pro se litigants in Kentucky and the Sixth Circuit (which also covers Ohio, Michigan, and Tennessee), this case provides strong authority that excessive force claims can survive summary judgment when the facts are in dispute, even when officers invoke qualified immunity.
