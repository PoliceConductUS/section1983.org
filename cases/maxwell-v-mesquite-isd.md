## What This Case Is About

A student (or the student's parent) sued the Mesquite Independent School District under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) after a school resource officer allegedly used [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force) against the student. The court dismissed the claims against the school district because the complaint failed to allege a specific [municipal policy or custom](/primer/monell-liability) or [failure to train](/primer/failure-to-train) that was the moving force behind the officer's conduct.

## The Facts

The plaintiff alleged that a school resource officer employed by or assigned to the Mesquite Independent School District used excessive physical force against a student. The complaint sought to hold the school district liable under [_Monell_](/cases/monell-v-department-of-social-services) on the theory that the district failed to adequately train or supervise its school resource officers regarding the constitutional limits on the use of force against students.

## What the Court Decided

The court dismissed the [Monell](/primer/monell-liability) claim against the school district. Under _Monell_, a school district — like any municipality — cannot be held liable on a [respondeat superior](/primer/respondeat-superior) theory simply because one of its employees committed a constitutional violation. The plaintiff must identify an official policy, widespread custom, or [failure to train](/primer/failure-to-train) that constitutes [deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference) and was the [moving force](/primer/moving-force-causation) behind the violation.

The court found the complaint's allegations were conclusory — it alleged the district "failed to train" without specifying what training was deficient, what training would have prevented the incident, whether there was a pattern of similar incidents, or whether the district was [deliberately indifferent](/primer/deliberate-indifference) to the need for training. Without a pattern of prior violations, the single-incident exception from [_City of Canton v. Harris_](/cases/city-of-canton-v-harris) requires showing a "complete failure to train" on a clearly recurring constitutional duty — a high bar the plaintiff did not meet.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

_Maxwell v. Mesquite ISD_ reinforces key principles for suing school districts and municipalities:

- **School districts are municipalities for § 1983 purposes**: They can be sued under _Monell_ but only for their own policies, customs, or training failures — not for the acts of individual employees.
- **Specificity in failure-to-train claims**: You must allege (1) what training was deficient, (2) how the deficiency was connected to the specific violation, (3) that the municipality was on notice (through a pattern or the "obvious" nature of the need), and (4) that proper training would have prevented the violation.
- **School resource officers**: When an SRO uses excessive force, determining whether to sue the school district, the police department, or both depends on who employs the officer and who controls their training. This can affect [Monell](/primer/monell-liability) analysis.
- **The pattern problem**: Without evidence of prior similar incidents, you are left with the narrow single-incident exception — which requires showing a complete absence of training on a clear, recurring constitutional duty.

## Key Takeaway

Suing a school district for a school resource officer's [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force) requires more than alleging the district "failed to train" — you must identify specific training deficiencies, show [deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference), and connect the deficiency to the violation, because [municipal liability](/primer/municipal-liability) under _Monell_ demands proof of a policy, custom, or training failure as the [moving force](/primer/moving-force-causation) behind the constitutional harm.
