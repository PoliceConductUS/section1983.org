## What This Case Is About

_Pinedo v. City of Dallas_ demonstrates the stringent [pleading standards](/primer/plausibility-pleading) for [municipal liability](/primer/municipal-liability) claims, even in tragic circumstances involving the police shooting of an unarmed person experiencing a mental health crisis. The court dismissed the claims against the City of Dallas while allowing individual officer claims to proceed.

## The Facts

In 2013, Dallas Police Officers Jamal Robinson and Mark Meltabarger responded to a 911 call from someone who heard noises in an adjacent residence and believed there was an intruder. Officer Robinson was a trainee in his first phase of field training under the supervision of Officer Meltabarger. Both officers were armed with pepper spray, a taser, a baton, and a firearm.

Gerardo Pinedo, Jr. ("Junior") was lawfully inside the residence. He was unarmed and had no weapon or device that could be perceived as a weapon. Before the shooting, the officers observed behavior indicating that Junior's thoughts, perceptions, and emotions were substantially impaired — suggesting he was suffering from mental illness or cognitive impairment and needed medical or psychological assistance.

Despite these observations, and despite having multiple less-lethal options available, the officers used [deadly force](/primer/deadly-force) against Junior, killing him. His father, Gerardo Pinedo, Sr., sued the officers individually and the City of Dallas under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983).

## What the Court Decided

The court granted the City's [motion to dismiss](/primer/motion-to-dismiss) under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.

**Municipal liability requires specificity**: The court applied the [_Iqbal_](/primer/plausibility-pleading) plausibility standard and found that Pinedo's complaint, even after amendment, failed to identify a specific city policy or custom that caused the constitutional violation. General allegations about inadequate training or supervision were insufficient.

**Failure to train**: Pinedo alleged that the city failed to adequately train officers in dealing with mentally impaired individuals. The court held that a [failure-to-train](/primer/failure-to-train) theory requires showing that the city had notice of a pattern of similar violations and was deliberately indifferent to the need for better training. A single incident — even a fatal one — is generally insufficient to establish deliberate indifference.

**Individual officer claims survived**: Importantly, the claims against Officers Robinson and Meltabarger were not dismissed. The allegations that they used deadly force against an unarmed, mentally impaired person when less-lethal alternatives were available stated plausible [excessive force](/primer/excessive-force) claims under the [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment).

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

- **Plead municipal liability with specificity**: Generic allegations about "inadequate training" or "failure to supervise" will not survive a [motion to dismiss](/primer/motion-to-dismiss). Identify the specific policy, custom, or training deficiency and explain how it caused the violation.
- **A single incident rarely establishes failure to train**: Unless your case presents the rare "single-incident liability" scenario where the need for training was _so obvious_ that failure to provide it was deliberately indifferent, you need evidence of prior similar incidents.
- **Mental health encounters deserve specialized training**: While courts have not broadly imposed a duty to provide mental health crisis training, the increasing frequency of such encounters strengthens arguments for pattern-based [failure-to-train](/primer/failure-to-train) claims.
- **Always maintain individual officer claims**: Even when your municipal claim fails, your claims against the individual officers may survive — as they did here. Officers who shoot unarmed, mentally impaired people when less-lethal options are available face strong excessive force claims.
- **Field training matters**: When a trainee officer uses deadly force under the supervision of a training officer, both may be liable — the trainee for the force itself and the trainer for [failure to supervise](/primer/failure-to-supervise).

## Key Takeaway

Even when officers shoot an unarmed, mentally impaired person while having less-lethal alternatives available, the city escapes liability unless you can plead specific facts showing a municipal policy, custom, or [failure to train](/primer/failure-to-train) with [deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference). Always pair your [municipal liability](/primer/municipal-liability) claim with individual-capacity claims against the officers, and research prior similar incidents to build your pattern evidence.
