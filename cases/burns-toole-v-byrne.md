## What This Case Is About

Burns-Toole v. Byrne involves a dental license applicant who alleged that members of the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners discriminated against her on the basis of her religion during the licensing examination process. The Fifth Circuit affirmed dismissal, finding no evidence to support the discrimination claim. While not a typical police misconduct case, it addresses the standards for proving constitutional violations under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) against state actors.

## The Facts

Dr. Peggy Burns-Toole, an African-American Seventh-Day Adventist, was a licensed dentist in Illinois who moved to Texas and applied to take the August 1990 state dental examination. The exam was scheduled for Thursday through Saturday, August 22–25. Because working on Friday evening and Saturday conflicted with the tenets of her faith, Burns-Toole requested and was granted an examination variance, taking those portions on Wednesday instead.

Dr. Ronald Shamblin, one of the board-appointed examiners, graded a portion of her examination. He knew her only as "Applicant #7" and had no access to information about her religious background. During the exam, Burns-Toole's equipment malfunctioned. Although she was given additional time, Shamblin and two other examiners concluded her performance on the gold onlay casting section was inadequate. She failed.

Burns-Toole alleged that her religious accommodation request led to discriminatory treatment by the examiners. She also claimed that Dr. Zeb Poindexter, who was monitoring African-American applicants' progress, had admonished her about seeking the religious variance, suggesting it drew negative attention.

Burns-Toole filed suit under § 1983, alleging that the examiners violated her constitutional rights by discriminating against her based on her religion.

## What the Court Decided

The Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's dismissal. The court found no evidence that the examiners knew about Burns-Toole's religious beliefs or that her religion played any role in the grading of her examination. The examiner who graded her work knew her only by a number, not by name or religious affiliation.

The court emphasized that § 1983 requires proof that the defendant's actions were motivated by a discriminatory purpose. Conclusory allegations of discrimination, without supporting facts, are insufficient to survive summary judgment. Burns-Toole failed to produce any evidence linking her exam failure to her religious accommodation request.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

Burns-Toole v. Byrne reinforces several principles applicable to § 1983 litigation:

- **Discriminatory intent must be proven.** A § 1983 claim based on discrimination requires evidence that the defendant acted with discriminatory purpose. Mere speculation or suspicion is not enough.

- **Blind grading undermines discrimination claims.** When decision-makers are unaware of the characteristic that allegedly motivated discrimination, it is very difficult to establish intentional discrimination.

- **Summary judgment standards are rigorous.** At summary judgment, a plaintiff must present concrete evidence, not just allegations, to show a genuine dispute of material fact. Conclusory assertions of discrimination will not defeat a motion for summary judgment.

## Key Takeaway

Burns-Toole v. Byrne demonstrates that § 1983 discrimination claims require proof of intentional, purposeful discrimination — not just an adverse outcome coupled with membership in a protected group. If the decision-maker was unaware of the plaintiff's protected characteristic, a discrimination claim will likely fail.
