## What This Case Is About

Omar Esparza, suffering from depression and anxiety, locked himself inside his family's home and refused to let his parents enter. His parents called 911 seeking medical help for their son. Instead, police responded, and after a failed negotiation, officers forced entry into the home and fatally shot Esparza. His parents sued the City of Houston under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983), alleging [municipal liability](/primer/monell-liability) for the officers' use of [deadly force](/primer/excessive-force). The Fifth Circuit affirmed summary judgment for the City, establishing the frequently cited three-element test for [Monell](/cases/monell-v-dep-t-of-soc-servs) liability.

## The Facts

On the day of the incident, Esparza—who had been suffering from depression and anxiety—became upset and locked himself inside the family home, refusing to let his parents enter. After about an hour, his parents, Jose and Asuncion Valle, called 911. Neither spoke English, so they requested a Spanish-speaking operator. They hoped the call would bring medical assistance.

Instead, the 911 dispatcher sent police officers. The Valles showed the first officer, Officer Duarte, papers from their previous attempts to get Esparza admitted to a hospital for psychiatric treatment and asked for help getting medical care. Duarte approached the house and spoke with Esparza in English. Additional officers arrived and spoke with Esparza, who said he would not come out and would not let anyone in.

Sergeant Bryant arrived and took control of the situation. After failing to communicate with Esparza, Bryant contacted police headquarters. Captain Williams of the SWAT/Hostage Negotiation Team directed that a Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) officer be called. CIT Officer Broussard negotiated with Esparza for thirty to forty minutes but could not persuade him to come out or allow entry. The non-CIT officers then sought and received permission from Captain Williams to forcefully enter the home—without consulting CIT Officer Broussard.

Esparza was not a suspect in any crime, had not threatened the officers or himself. Nonetheless, Captain Williams authorized entry, though he was not present at the scene and had no direct communication with the CIT officer. Sergeant Bryant and three officers armed themselves with a Taser, a bean-bag shotgun, and sidearms. While CIT Officer Broussard continued negotiating, the officers broke through the front door. Esparza was shot and killed.

## What the Court Decided

The Fifth Circuit affirmed summary judgment for the City on all claims. The court articulated the three-element test for municipal liability that has become the standard formulation in the Fifth Circuit:

> Municipal liability requires proof of three elements: "(1) an official policy (or custom), of which (2) a policymaker can be charged with actual or constructive knowledge, and (3) a constitutional violation whose 'moving force' is that policy or custom."

The court found that while the shooting raised serious questions, the Valles failed to establish municipal liability. On the official policy element, the court found that the Valles pointed to no written policy authorizing the use of force against mentally ill, non-threatening individuals. Their argument that the City had an informal custom or practice was unsupported by evidence of a pattern of similar incidents.

On the failure-to-train theory, the court found insufficient evidence that the City's training was inadequate or that any inadequacy was the moving force behind the constitutional violation. The court noted that the City did have a CIT program, which undercut the argument that the City was deliberately indifferent to the need for training in handling mentally ill individuals.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

**The Valle three-part test is the standard for municipal liability.** This formulation is cited in virtually every Fifth Circuit municipal liability case. To hold a city liable, you must prove all three elements—a policy or custom, policymaker knowledge, and moving-force causation.

**Mental health calls demand careful police response.** While this case did not result in liability for the City, it highlights the dangers of escalating encounters with mentally ill, non-threatening individuals. The fact that officers overrode the CIT officer's negotiation efforts without consultation is a cautionary example.

**Having a CIT program can undercut failure-to-train claims.** The City's existing Crisis Intervention Team program was evidence against deliberate indifference. If you are suing a city for failure to train officers in mental health crisis response, you need to show that the training was inadequate—not just that officers failed to follow it.

**Moving force is the hardest element to prove.** Even when a plainly bad outcome occurs, connecting it to a specific municipal policy rather than individual officer misconduct is the most challenging aspect of Monell liability.

## Key Takeaway

Valle v. City of Houston establishes the three-element framework for municipal liability that governs virtually all § 1983 claims against cities in the Fifth Circuit. The case demonstrates that even tragic outcomes—like the fatal shooting of a mentally ill man whose parents called 911 seeking medical help—may not result in municipal liability if the plaintiff cannot identify a specific policy or custom that was the moving force behind the constitutional violation.
