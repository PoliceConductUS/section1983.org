## What This Case Is About

William Banda pleaded guilty to aggravated robbery, a first-degree felony, without a plea bargain. He was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. His court-appointed appellate counsel filed an _Anders_ brief, concluding there were no arguable grounds for appeal. The Thirteenth Court of Appeals conducted an independent review of the record and affirmed the conviction. While not a § 1983 case, _Banda_ illustrates the _Anders_ procedure and the appellate process for criminal defendants whose counsel finds no meritorious issues.

## The Facts

The State of Texas charged William Banda with aggravated robbery under Texas Penal Code § 29.03. The specific facts of the underlying offense are not detailed in the appellate opinion because the case reached the court in the posture of an _Anders_ brief—a procedural vehicle used when appellate counsel concludes after reviewing the record that there are no non-frivolous grounds for appeal.

Banda pleaded guilty without a plea bargain, and the trial court found him guilty. Following a pre-sentence investigation, the trial court sentenced Banda to five years' imprisonment in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice–Institutional Division. Notably, the court did not include a deadly weapon finding. Because Banda's sentence was not the result of a plea bargain, he was granted the right to appeal.

Banda's court-appointed appellate counsel reviewed the entire record and concluded there were no arguable grounds on which to base an appeal. Counsel filed an _Anders_ brief and a motion to withdraw.

## What the Court Decided

The Thirteenth Court of Appeals followed the procedure established by _Anders v. California_, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), and its Texas progeny.

First, the court confirmed that counsel's brief met the _Anders_ requirements: it presented a professional evaluation of the record, provided references to the facts and procedural history, and set out pertinent legal authorities explaining why there were no arguable grounds for appeal.

Second, the court verified that counsel had complied with the notification requirements under _High v. State_ and _Kelly v. State_: counsel had notified Banda that an _Anders_ brief was filed, provided copies of the brief and motion to withdraw, informed Banda of his rights to file a pro se response, review the record, and seek discretionary review, and provided Banda with a copy of the appellate record. Adequate time passed, and Banda did not file a pro se response.

Third, the court conducted its own **independent review of the entire record** to determine whether the case was wholly frivolous. After examining the proceedings, the court found no reversible error and affirmed the trial court's judgment.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

While _Banda_ is a state criminal case rather than a civil rights action, it provides useful context for § 1983 practitioners in several ways:

**The _Anders_ procedure protects defendants.** When appellate counsel determines there are no meritorious issues, the court does not simply take counsel's word for it. The appellate court independently reviews the entire record, providing a safeguard against overlooked issues.

**Criminal convictions can affect § 1983 claims.** Under the [Heck doctrine](/primer/heck-doctrine) (from [_Heck v. Humphrey_](/cases/heck-v-humphrey)), a § 1983 claim that would necessarily imply the invalidity of a criminal conviction is barred unless the conviction has been reversed or otherwise invalidated. A conviction affirmed through the _Anders_ process remains intact and may bar related civil rights claims.

**Guilty pleas and their consequences.** A voluntary guilty plea typically waives many potential constitutional challenges. If you are considering bringing a § 1983 claim related to the circumstances of an arrest or prosecution, the existence of a guilty plea can significantly complicate your case.

**Preserving issues for appeal.** The _Anders_ process underscores the importance of raising issues at the trial court level. Issues not preserved in the trial record are generally unavailable on appeal.

## Key Takeaway

When appellate counsel finds no arguable grounds for appeal and files an _Anders_ brief, the appellate court independently reviews the entire record before affirming. This case illustrates the procedural safeguards Texas courts apply to protect criminal defendants, and serves as a reminder that criminal convictions—even those affirmed through the _Anders_ process—can have downstream effects on related § 1983 civil rights claims through the Heck doctrine.
