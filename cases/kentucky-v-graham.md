## What Happened

Respondents were arrested following the warrantless raid of a house in Kentucky by local and state police officers who were seeking a murder suspect. Claiming a deprivation of federal rights from the officers' use of excessive force and other constitutional violations during the raid, respondents sued under § 1983 seeking money damages. Among the named defendants were the Commissioner of the Kentucky State Police, "individually and as Commissioner," and the Commonwealth of Kentucky — which was sued only for attorney's fees if respondents eventually prevailed. The District Court dismissed the Commonwealth as a party based on the Eleventh Amendment. The case settled, and respondents moved for costs and attorney's fees from the Commonwealth under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.

## What the Court Decided

In a unanimous decision by Justice Marshall, the Supreme Court reversed the fee award against Kentucky. The opinion laid out the definitive explanation of the individual-versus-official-capacity distinction that governs all § 1983 litigation:

**Personal-capacity suits** seek to impose personal liability upon a government official for actions taken under color of state law. A victory is against the individual. Damages come from the official's personal assets. To win, you need only show the official caused a deprivation of federal rights under color of law. The official can raise personal immunity defenses ([qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity)).

**Official-capacity suits** are "generally represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent." The real party in interest is the government entity. A victory is against the entity. To win, you must show the entity's "policy or custom" played a part in the violation (the [_Monell_](/primer/monell-liability) requirement). The entity **cannot** raise qualified immunity ([_Owen v. City of Independence_](/cases/owen-v-city-of-independence)), but states can raise Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity.

Because this was necessarily a personal-capacity action (the Eleventh Amendment barred official-capacity damages against Kentucky), fees could not be recovered from the Commonwealth. "Fee liability runs with merits liability" — if the entity wasn't liable on the merits, it isn't liable for fees.

## What It Means in Practice

_Kentucky v. Graham_ is the case every § 1983 plaintiff must understand when deciding _whom_ to sue and _how_ to caption the complaint. Getting this wrong can be fatal:

- Sue an officer in **personal capacity** → you can get damages from the officer personally, but you face qualified immunity and the government doesn't pay
- Sue an officer in **official capacity** → it's really a suit against the entity, you must prove _Monell_, no QI defense, but you face Eleventh Amendment if it's a state
- Sue the **municipality directly** → same as official capacity against local officials, but municipalities have no Eleventh Amendment immunity

The practical takeaway: **always sue both ways** — individual capacity to hold the officer personally liable, and the municipality directly for _Monell_ liability. If suing state officials, official-capacity suits for damages in federal court are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.

## How You Can Use It

- **Clarify your complaint**: Make explicit whether you're suing in individual capacity, official capacity, or both. "The course of proceedings" will typically indicate the nature of liability, but ambiguity invites problems.
- **Key quote**: "Personal-capacity suits seek to impose personal liability upon a government official for actions he takes under color of state law. Official-capacity suits, in contrast, 'generally represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent.'" 473 U.S. at 165-166.
- **Template**: "Plaintiff sues [Officer] in [his/her] individual capacity pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for [description of constitutional violation]. Plaintiff also sues [Municipality] directly under _Monell v. Department of Social Services_, 436 U.S. 658 (1978), for [policy/custom/failure to train]."
- **Fee recovery**: Ensure you have a proper merits claim against the entity from which you seek fees. Fees run with merits liability.

## How It Can Be Used Against You

- **Wrong capacity = wrong defendant**: If you sue a state official in official capacity for damages, the Eleventh Amendment bars the claim. If you sue in personal capacity only, you can't recover fees from the government.
- **No respondeat superior**: "A municipality cannot be made liable under § 1983 on a respondeat superior basis." You cannot bootstrap fee liability against the government from a personal-capacity victory against an officer.
- **Ambiguous complaints**: If your complaint doesn't specify capacity, courts may construe it against you — particularly if you failed to serve the entity or give it notice.

**How to counter**: Draft complaints with explicit capacity designations. Name the municipality directly as a defendant for _Monell_ claims. Name officers in their individual capacities for personal liability. This belt-and-suspenders approach preserves all avenues for relief and fee recovery.
