## What This Case Is About

The police in Bloomingdale, Illinois, received an anonymous letter claiming that a husband and wife were selling drugs, describing in detail how they would transport drugs from Florida. The police corroborated parts of the tip, obtained a [search warrant](/primer/warrant-requirement), and found marijuana in the couple's car and home. The question was whether an anonymous tip that didn't independently satisfy both "prongs" of the old _Aguilar-Spinelli_ test could still support [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause).

## The Facts

On May 3, 1978, the Bloomingdale Police Department received an anonymous letter. It stated that Lance and Susan Gates were drug dealers, that Susan would drive to Florida on May 3 and Lance would fly down a few days later, that the car's trunk would be loaded with drugs, and that the couple had over $100,000 worth of drugs in their basement. A detective verified that Lance Gates made a reservation on a May 5 flight to West Palm Beach. DEA surveillance confirmed Lance took the flight, stayed overnight in a motel room registered in Susan's name, and the next morning left with a woman in a car with Illinois plates, heading north. Based on the officer's affidavit setting forth these facts and the anonymous letter, a state court judge issued a search warrant. When the Gateses arrived home, police found marijuana and other contraband in their car trunk and home.

The Illinois courts suppressed the evidence, holding that the anonymous letter and affidavit failed the _Aguilar-Spinelli_ two-pronged test because they did not adequately establish the informant's "basis of knowledge" or "veracity."

## What the Court Decided

The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 opinion by Justice Rehnquist, abandoned the rigid _Aguilar-Spinelli_ two-pronged test and replaced it with a "totality of the circumstances" approach. The Court held that the elements of the old test — the informant's "veracity," "reliability," and "basis of knowledge" — should be understood as closely intertwined issues that illuminate the practical question of whether [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause) exists.

The task of the issuing magistrate is to make a "practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place." A deficiency in one factor may be compensated by a strong showing in another, or by independent police corroboration. Here, the extensive police corroboration of the anonymous tip's predictions established probable cause under this more flexible standard.

The Court also emphasized that reviewing courts should give "great deference" to a magistrate's probable cause determination.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

_Gates_ is foundational for any [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) case involving [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment) search or seizure issues. It governs:

- **[False arrest](/primer/false-arrest) claims**: If officers argue they had [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause) based on an informant's tip, courts apply the _Gates_ totality-of-the-circumstances test.
- **[Warrant challenges](/primer/warrant-requirement)**: If you're challenging the validity of a search warrant based on an informant tip, _Gates_ is the standard the court applies.
- **[Qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity)**: Even if probable cause was ultimately lacking, officers may claim they reasonably relied on a magistrate's warrant. But if the affidavit was so lacking that no reasonable officer could have believed probable cause existed, [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity) fails.
- **[Franks violations](/primer/franks-violation)**: If officers included false statements or omitted critical information in the warrant affidavit, you can challenge the warrant under _Franks v. Delaware_, but the underlying probable cause standard is still _Gates_.

**Key quote**: "The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the 'veracity' and 'basis of knowledge' of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place."

## Key Takeaway

[Probable cause](/primer/probable-cause) for a search warrant based on an informant's tip is evaluated under a flexible "totality of the circumstances" test — not rigid, independent requirements for the informant's veracity and basis of knowledge — and a magistrate's probable cause finding receives great deference on review.
