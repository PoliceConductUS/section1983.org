## What This Case Is About

_Hale v. Townley_ addresses the circumstances under which private individuals can be held liable under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) when they conspire with government officials to deprive someone of constitutional rights. The Fifth Circuit held that when private parties act in concert with state actors to violate constitutional rights, both the government officials and the private parties can face § 1983 liability. The case is an important statement on [state action](/primer/state-action) and [§ 1983 conspiracy](/primer/section-1983-conspiracy).

## The Facts

The case involved allegations that government officials and private parties worked together to deprive the plaintiff of constitutional rights. The private defendants argued they could not be sued under § 1983 because they were not state actors — § 1983 applies only to persons acting "under [color of law](/primer/color-of-law)."

The plaintiff alleged a conspiracy between the government officials and private parties, arguing that the private parties' joint participation in the scheme with state actors satisfied the color-of-law requirement. The district court addressed the viability of these claims, and the case reached the Fifth Circuit.

## What the Court Decided

The Fifth Circuit held that private parties who conspire with government officials to violate constitutional rights can be held liable under § 1983. The court explained that the [color of law](/primer/color-of-law) requirement is satisfied when a private individual is a "willful participant in joint action with the State or its agents." A private party need not be a formal government employee — acting jointly with a state actor to deprive someone of constitutional rights is sufficient.

To establish a [§ 1983 conspiracy](/primer/section-1983-conspiracy), a plaintiff must show: (1) an agreement between the private party and a state actor; (2) to deprive the plaintiff of constitutional rights; and (3) an actual deprivation of rights that occurred as a result. The conspiracy need not be formal — it can be inferred from circumstantial evidence showing coordinated action between the private party and the government.

The court emphasized that this conspiracy theory requires more than conclusory allegations. The plaintiff must plead specific facts showing an agreement or meeting of the minds between the private party and the government actor.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

_Hale v. Townley_ is important when your case involves private parties who helped government officials violate your rights. Common examples include private security companies that work with police, informants who participate in unconstitutional raids, or private individuals who instigate false arrests by providing false information to officers with knowledge that the arrest will be unjustified.

The case establishes that § 1983's reach extends beyond government employees. If a private person was actively involved in the deprivation of your rights and acted in coordination with a state actor, you can name that private person as a defendant. But you must allege specific facts showing the [conspiracy](/primer/section-1983-conspiracy) — bare assertions of collusion are not enough.

## Key Takeaway

Section 1983 is not limited to government employees. Private parties who conspire with state actors to violate constitutional rights can also be held liable. The key is showing joint action — an agreement or coordinated effort between the private party and the government official to deprive you of your rights. If a private person worked hand-in-hand with police to cause your unconstitutional arrest, seizure, or other deprivation, [*Hale v. Townley*] gives you a basis to include them in your § 1983 suit.
