## What This Case Is About

Decided the same day as [Terry v. Ohio](/cases/terry-v-ohio), _Sibron v. New York_ addressed the limits of stop-and-frisk authority. While _Terry_ approved a limited pat-down for weapons based on reasonable suspicion, _Sibron_ held that an officer who observed a man talking with known drug addicts for eight hours did not have the right to reach into the man's pocket—a search that exceeded the scope of a permissible _Terry_ frisk and was not supported by [probable cause](/primer/probable-cause).

## The Facts

At about 4:00 p.m., Patrolman Martin spotted Nelson Sibron in the vicinity of 742 Broadway. From then until midnight, Sibron remained in the area. During that eight-hour period, the officer observed Sibron talking with six to eight persons whom the officer knew from experience to be narcotics addicts. Later, around midnight, Sibron went into a restaurant where the officer saw him speak with three more known addicts.

While Sibron was eating in the restaurant, the officer approached and asked him to come outside. Sibron complied. The officer then said, "You know what I am after." Sibron mumbled something and reached into his left coat pocket. The officer also moved his hand to the pocket and seized what was inside—which turned out to be heroin. The officer testified that he "thought he might have been" reaching for a gun.

New York's counsel attempted to confess error, suggesting the search violated the [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment), but the Supreme Court declined to accept this confession.

## What the Court Decided

The Supreme Court reversed Sibron's conviction, holding that the search violated the Fourth Amendment on two separate grounds.

First, the officer lacked probable cause to arrest Sibron. Merely observing someone talking with known addicts—even over many hours—does not establish probable cause to believe the person possesses narcotics. The officer's own testimony showed he was looking for narcotics the entire time, yet his observations provided only bare suspicion, not probable cause.

Second, even under the newly announced _Terry_ framework, the officer's actions exceeded the permissible scope of a stop-and-frisk. A _Terry_ frisk is limited to a pat-down of outer clothing to detect weapons when the officer reasonably believes the suspect is armed and dangerous. Here, the officer did not conduct a limited pat-down but instead reached directly into Sibron's pocket—a full search. Moreover, the officer's stated justification shifted between searching for drugs and protecting himself from a weapon, undermining both rationales.

Justice Harlan's concurrence emphasized that probable cause for an arrest and [reasonable suspicion](/primer/reasonable-suspicion) for a stop are distinct standards, and that the officer's observations, while perhaps justifying a brief stop, did not justify the invasive search that occurred.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

**Association alone does not create probable cause.** Talking with people known to police—even suspected criminals—does not by itself give officers probable cause to search you. This principle protects the right of association and prevents guilt by mere proximity.

**Frisks have strict limits.** A [Terry](/cases/terry-v-ohio) frisk is limited to a pat-down of outer clothing for weapons. When officers reach into your pockets without first feeling a weapon-like object through your clothing, they have exceeded the scope of a lawful frisk and conducted a full search requiring probable cause.

**Officer testimony matters.** When an officer's stated justification for a search shifts between safety and evidence-gathering, courts may find that neither justification was genuine. Inconsistent testimony undermines the officer's credibility and the legality of the search.

**Companion to _Terry v. Ohio_.** While _Terry_ expanded police authority to conduct brief investigatory stops, _Sibron_ established the outer boundaries of that authority. Together, these cases define the rules governing street encounters between police and citizens.

## Key Takeaway

Observing someone associate with known drug users—even for hours—does not give police the right to search that person's pockets. A Terry frisk is limited to a brief pat-down for weapons, not a full exploratory search. When officers skip the pat-down and go directly into a suspect's pockets, they have conducted an unconstitutional search unless they had independent probable cause. This case marks the boundary line between a permissible Terry frisk and an illegal search.
