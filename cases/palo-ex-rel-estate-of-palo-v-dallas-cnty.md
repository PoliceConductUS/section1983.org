## What This Case Is About

_Palo ex rel. Estate of Palo v. Dallas County_ involves a [pretrial detainee's](/primer/pretrial-detention) death in the Dallas County Jail and whether the county's failure to provide adequate medical care violated the [Fourteenth Amendment](/primer/fourteenth-amendment) Due Process Clause. The court allowed the conditions-of-confinement claim to proceed to trial while granting partial summary judgment on other claims.

## The Facts

Frank Nelson Palo, Jr. suffered from hypertensive cardiovascular disease, Crohn's disease, congestive heart disease, and congestive heart failure. He was booked into the Dallas County Jail on charges of driving while license suspended and failure to leave identification. During intake, a UTMB nurse noted his medical history. Frank reported taking Lasix, a diuretic medication, approximately three days before his admission.

Dallas County had contracted with the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (UTMB) to provide medical services to jail inmates. After the nurse determined that Frank did not have any health problems that required immediate attention, he was referred to a UTMB physician to schedule a further evaluation and was assigned to a general population tank. Five days after intake, detention officers found Frank lying on his bunk unresponsive. He was transported to a hospital and pronounced dead. An autopsy revealed he died of hypertensive heart disease.

His family — Kathy Palo as administratrix and Chree Palo as intervenor-plaintiff — sued Dallas County and Sheriff Lupe Valdez under [42 U.S.C. § 1983](/primer/section-1983) and Texas law, alleging that inadequate medical care constituted [deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference) to Frank's serious medical needs.

## What the Court Decided

The court granted summary judgment in part and denied it in part.

**Episodic act or omission claim dismissed**: The court granted summary judgment on the episodic act or omission claim, finding that Palo failed to adduce evidence that any particular jail official with responsibilities over the general population tank knew about Frank's heart condition or his need for medication, or that any official subjectively intended harm to occur.

**Conditions of confinement claim survived**: The court denied summary judgment on the conditions-of-confinement claim because defendants did not adequately address it in their motion. Because Frank was a pretrial detainee, his rights were governed by the [Fourteenth Amendment](/primer/fourteenth-amendment) Due Process Clause rather than the [Eighth Amendment](/primer/eighth-amendment). The court applied the _Bell v. Wolfish_ test for conditions of confinement.

**Other rulings**: The court dismissed the action against Sheriff Valdez in her official capacity as duplicative of the claim against Dallas County. It dismissed the request for injunctive relief as moot (due to Frank's death) or for lack of standing. State-law claims were dismissed as barred by sovereign immunity.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

- **Pretrial detainees get Fourteenth Amendment protection**: If you or a loved one was harmed while awaiting trial, your claims arise under the [Fourteenth Amendment](/primer/fourteenth-amendment) Due Process Clause, which provides at least as much protection as the Eighth Amendment.
- **Jail medical care must be adequate**: When a detainee has known serious medical conditions and the jail fails to provide appropriate monitoring and treatment, that failure can constitute [deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference).
- **Contracted medical services don't shield the county**: Even when a county outsources medical care to a private company (like UTMB), the county remains liable under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) if its policies or oversight failures caused the constitutional violation.
- **Document medical needs at intake**: If you are booked into jail, report all medical conditions and medications. This creates a record that the jail knew of your needs — a critical element for proving deliberate indifference.
- **Death cases strengthen municipal liability**: When inadequate care results in death, courts are more likely to find that systemic deficiencies — not just individual negligence — were the [moving force](/primer/moving-force-causation) behind the violation.

## Key Takeaway

When a pretrial detainee with documented serious medical conditions dies in custody due to inadequate medical care, the jail and county face liability under the [Fourteenth Amendment](/primer/fourteenth-amendment). The county cannot insulate itself by contracting with private medical providers — if systemic deficiencies in oversight and care caused the death, [municipal liability](/primer/municipal-liability) under [_Monell_](/primer/monell-liability) is squarely in play.
