## What This Case Is About

Leonard McCollan's brother somehow obtained a duplicate of McCollan's driver's license—with the brother's photo on it. The brother was arrested on narcotics charges, booked under McCollan's name, and released on bond. When the brother failed to appear, an arrest warrant was issued in McCollan's name. McCollan was arrested under that warrant and, despite protesting that he was the wrong person, was held in jail for several days before the error was discovered. McCollan sued the sheriff under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983), claiming his detention violated due process. The Supreme Court held that § 1983 requires a deprivation of a constitutional right, and being detained under a valid warrant—even mistakenly—does not necessarily violate due process.

## The Facts

McCollan's brother procured a duplicate of McCollan's Texas driver's license, except with the brother's photograph. The brother was arrested on narcotics charges and booked under McCollan's name. He was released on bond but never appeared for his court date.

A bench warrant was issued for McCollan's arrest. Potter County Sheriff's deputies arrested the real McCollan pursuant to that warrant. McCollan protested that he was not the right person—that he was the victim of mistaken identity—but he was held in the Potter County jail for approximately three days before the error was discovered and he was released.

McCollan brought suit against Sheriff Baker and his surety under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming his detention deprived him of liberty without [due process](/primer/substantive-due-process) of law. The District Court directed a verdict in favor of the sheriff. The Fifth Circuit reversed, characterizing the claim as a "§ 1983 false imprisonment action" and holding that McCollan was entitled to have his claim presented to a jury even if the evidence supported only negligence.

## What the Court Decided

The Supreme Court reversed, in an opinion by Justice Rehnquist joined by five other justices.

The Court established a foundational principle: **§ 1983 requires a deprivation of a right "secured by the Constitution and laws."** The threshold question is not whether the plaintiff suffered an injury, but whether that injury amounted to a constitutional violation. Not every tort committed by a state official rises to the level of a constitutional deprivation.

Applying this principle, the Court held that McCollan was arrested pursuant to a warrant that conformed to [Fourth Amendment](/primer/fourth-amendment) requirements—it was facially valid and issued by a court based on probable cause. His subsequent detention was therefore pursuant to legal process, not a random or arbitrary deprivation of liberty.

The Court further held that a sheriff executing a valid arrest warrant **is not constitutionally required to investigate independently every claim of innocence**, whether based on mistaken identity or on a substantive defense. The Constitution requires probable cause for arrest and a speedy trial—not error-free investigation of identity claims.

Finally, the Court stated plainly: **"The tort of false imprisonment does not become a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment merely because the defendant is a state official."** State tort remedies, not § 1983, are the appropriate vehicle for addressing such claims.

Justice Stevens, joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall, dissented, arguing that holding an innocent person in jail for three days despite protests of mistaken identity should constitute a due process violation.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

**§ 1983 is not a general tort statute.** This is one of the most frequently cited principles in civil rights litigation. Not every wrong committed by a government official creates a constitutional claim. You must identify a specific constitutional right that was violated.

**Valid warrants provide strong protection.** When an arrest is made pursuant to a facially valid warrant, the burden shifts significantly. The existence of the warrant establishes that a neutral magistrate found probable cause, making it much harder to claim the arrest violated the Fourth Amendment or due process.

**Negligence is not enough.** The Court's reasoning implies that mere negligence—such as failing to catch a mistaken-identity problem—does not constitute the kind of deliberate or reckless conduct required for a constitutional violation under § 1983. This principle was later developed more fully in _Daniels v. Williams_ and _County of Sacramento v. Lewis_.

**State tort remedies may be your path.** If your injury is based on a mistake rather than a constitutional violation—such as being detained under the wrong person's warrant—state tort law (false imprisonment, negligence) may be a more appropriate avenue than federal civil rights litigation.

## Key Takeaway

Being arrested and detained under a valid warrant—even if you are the wrong person—does not automatically create a § 1983 claim. The Constitution requires probable cause for arrest and a speedy trial, not error-free policing. To state a claim under § 1983, you must show a deprivation of a specific constitutional right, not merely a tort that happened to be committed by someone wearing a badge.
