## What This Case Is About

After Carol Vincent allegedly threatened to kill the mayor and a city council member during a heated encounter at a bank, police issued a no-trespass order prohibiting her from entering city-owned property, including City Hall. The district attorney later determined that the allegations did not support prosecution, and the order was lifted. Vincent sued under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983), claiming the no-trespass order violated her procedural due process rights because it was issued without notice or an opportunity to be heard. The Fifth Circuit reversed the denial of [qualified immunity](/primer/qualified-immunity), holding that the law was not clearly established.

## The Facts

On August 7, 2012, Carol Vincent went to a bank to discuss a financial matter on a friend's behalf. The meeting became acrimonious and Vincent left. Later that day, the Sulphur Police Department received information that, during the argument, Vincent had threatened to get a gun and kill Mayor Christopher Duncan and City Councilman Mike Koonce. Because the alleged incident occurred outside the city limits, the information was referred to the sheriff's department for investigation.

The next day, a sheriff's detective called Vincent and asked her to come to the station for questioning. Vincent complied and was interrogated. She specifically denied threatening the two officials.

Two days later, Officer Gremillion pulled Vincent's car over to inform her that a no-trespass order had been issued, prohibiting her from entering certain city property. Vincent was not given advance notice of the order, nor was she given an opportunity to contest it before it was issued. The order was signed by Police Chief Lewis Coats and effectively barred Vincent from City Hall and other city-owned properties.

After the district attorney reviewed the allegations and determined they did not support prosecution, police lifted the no-trespass order. Vincent then sued Chief Coats, Officers Gremillion and Martin, and the City of Sulphur under § 1983, claiming violations of procedural due process, substantive due process, and other constitutional rights.

## What the Court Decided

The district court granted qualified immunity on most claims but denied it on Vincent's procedural due process and direct municipal liability claims. The district court concluded that issuing the no-trespass order without notice and an opportunity to be heard violated the standards set forth in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319 (1976), and that this law was clearly established.

The Fifth Circuit reversed. While the court assumed that the officers' conduct might have violated Vincent's procedural due process rights, it held that the law was **not clearly established** at the time of the incident. The court found no prior case law that would have put a reasonable officer on notice that issuing a no-trespass order for city property—in response to alleged death threats against city officials—without a pre-deprivation hearing violated the Constitution.

The court emphasized that qualified immunity protects "all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law." Because the specific question—whether due process requires notice and a hearing before issuing a no-trespass order for public property in response to threats of violence—had not been addressed by prior precedent, the officers were entitled to qualified immunity.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

**"Clearly established" is a demanding standard.** Even if officers violate your constitutional rights, you cannot recover damages if the right was not clearly established at the time. This requires existing precedent that places the constitutional question "beyond debate."

**Novel applications of due process face uphill battles.** When your claim involves a factual scenario that no prior court has addressed—like no-trespass orders for public property—qualified immunity is likely to apply because officers cannot be expected to predict how courts will apply general constitutional principles to new situations.

**Pre-deprivation hearings are not always required.** While due process generally requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before the government deprives you of a protected interest, the specific circumstances may affect when that process must occur—and reasonable officers may disagree about what the Constitution requires in unusual situations.

## Key Takeaway

Vincent v. City of Sulphur illustrates how the "clearly established" prong of qualified immunity can shield officers even when their conduct may have violated constitutional rights. For § 1983 plaintiffs, the case is a stark reminder that winning on the merits is not enough—you must also show that the law was so clearly established that every reasonable officer would have known the conduct was unlawful. When your case involves a novel application of constitutional principles, qualified immunity is a formidable obstacle.
