## What Happened

Joe Baird and other plaintiffs were involved in a traffic stop conducted by Indiana police officer John Renbarger. Despite being compliant and non-resistant, the plaintiffs alleged that Renbarger used excessive and gratuitous force during the stop, including physical violence against individuals who posed no threat. The plaintiffs filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and Renbarger sought qualified immunity.

## What the Court Said

The Seventh Circuit denied qualified immunity to Officer Renbarger, holding that the right to be free from excessive force during a traffic stop was clearly established. The court emphasized that when a suspect is compliant and not resisting, officers cannot use gratuitous physical force. The court applied the Graham v. Connor factors and found that the force used was objectively unreasonable given the circumstances — particularly the lack of any threat or resistance from the plaintiffs.

## Why This Case Matters

Baird v. Renbarger is significant for pro se litigants in Indiana and throughout the Seventh Circuit because it demonstrates that qualified immunity is not automatic — officers can be held personally liable when they use unnecessary force against compliant individuals. The case reinforces that the Fourth Amendment protects people during routine police encounters like traffic stops, and that officers who escalate force without justification will face consequences. With 124 citations, this case provides solid authority for excessive force claims arising from traffic stops in Indiana.
