## What This Case Is About

Harry Keane sued Fox Television, Simon Cowell, FremantleMedia, and others, alleging that the _American Idol_ television show infringed his trademark and misappropriated his ideas. The court dismissed the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, applying the standard that a complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations — not just legal conclusions — to support recovery.

## The Facts

Keane claimed he had developed a concept for a talent competition television show and that the defendants stole his idea when they created _American Idol_. He brought federal trademark infringement and state common law claims for trademark infringement, unfair competition, breach of implied contract, misappropriation of idea/trade secrets, and quantum meruit. He attached documents to his complaint, but those documents contradicted some of his allegations.

## What the Court Decided

The court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss. Applying the Rule 12(b)(6) standard, the court emphasized that when a plaintiff attaches documents to a complaint that contradict the complaint's own statements, "the more specific document controls." The court reiterated the established principle that complaints "must contain either direct allegations on every material point necessary to sustain a recovery ... or contain allegations from which an inference fairly may be drawn that evidence on these material points will be introduced at trial."

The court found that Keane's allegations were insufficient because the attached documents undermined his claims rather than supporting them, and his remaining allegations were too conclusory to state a plausible claim.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

_Keane v. Fox Television_ is cited in [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) cases for its articulation of Rule 12(b)(6) principles:

- **Documents attached to complaints**: If you attach exhibits to your complaint, make sure they support your allegations. Courts will credit the documents over inconsistent narrative allegations. This matters in [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) cases where plaintiffs attach police reports, incident reports, or [body camera](/primer/body-camera-footage) transcripts that may contradict their version of events.
- **Specificity matters**: While Federal Rule 8 requires only a "short and plain statement," your factual allegations must be specific enough that a court can reasonably infer the defendant is liable. Conclusory assertions — "the officer violated my rights" — are not enough.
- **Practical tip**: Before attaching documents to your complaint, review them carefully. If they contain facts favorable to the defense, consider whether attaching them is necessary. If the document is central to your claim, the defense will likely introduce it anyway, but attaching it yourself removes the opportunity to explain its context in your narrative.

## Key Takeaway

Documents attached to a complaint control over inconsistent narrative allegations — so when filing a [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) complaint, ensure that any exhibits you attach actually support your claims, and make sure your factual allegations are specific enough to state a plausible basis for recovery.
