## What This Case Is About

A plaintiff sued the City of Dallas and individual officers under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983), alleging constitutional violations during an encounter with police. The court dismissed the claims against the city because the plaintiff failed to identify a specific [municipal policy or custom](/primer/monell-liability) that caused the alleged violations, instead relying on conclusory allegations of inadequate training and supervision.

## The Facts

The plaintiff alleged that Dallas police officers violated her constitutional rights during an encounter. She sued both the individual officers and the City of Dallas, seeking to hold the city liable under [_Monell v. Department of Social Services_](/cases/monell-v-department-of-social-services). Her complaint alleged generally that the city failed to adequately train and supervise its officers and that this failure constituted a policy or custom of tolerating constitutional violations.

## What the Court Decided

The court granted the City of Dallas's [motion to dismiss](/primer/motion-to-dismiss) under Rule 12(b)(6). The court reiterated that a municipality cannot be held liable under [§ 1983](/primer/section-1983) on a [respondeat superior](/primer/respondeat-superior) theory. Under _Monell_, the plaintiff must identify (1) an official policy or widespread custom (2) that was the [moving force](/primer/moving-force-causation) behind the constitutional violation.

The court found the plaintiff's allegations too conclusory under [_Iqbal_](/cases/ashcroft-v-iqbal). Simply alleging that the city "failed to train" or "failed to supervise" without specific facts about the training deficiency, how it was connected to the specific constitutional violation, or evidence of [deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference) was insufficient. The complaint did not identify what training was missing, how the city was on notice of the deficiency, or how different training would have prevented the violation.

## Why This Case Matters for Your § 1983 Case

_MacCloskey_ is a cautionary tale about pleading [Monell liability](/primer/monell-liability):

- **Specificity required**: You cannot simply allege that a city "failed to train" or "failed to supervise" its officers. You must identify the specific training deficiency and explain how it caused the constitutional violation.
- **Moving force**: You must connect the policy or custom to the specific violation. Vague allegations about general inadequacies are not enough.
- **Pattern or single-incident theory**: If you're relying on a [failure-to-train](/primer/failure-to-train) theory, you need either (a) a pattern of similar violations putting the city on notice, or (b) a complete failure to train in a clearly recurring situation (the _Canton_ single-incident exception).
- **Practical tips for pleading Monell**:
  - Identify the specific policy, custom, or training deficiency
  - Explain how the city knew or should have known about it
  - Show how it was the "moving force" behind the specific violation you suffered
  - If possible, cite prior incidents showing a pattern

## Key Takeaway

To hold a city liable under [_Monell_](/cases/monell-v-department-of-social-services), your complaint must go beyond conclusory allegations of "failure to train" or "failure to supervise" — you must identify the specific policy or training deficiency, demonstrate [deliberate indifference](/primer/deliberate-indifference), and show how that deficiency was the [moving force](/primer/moving-force-causation) behind the constitutional violation you suffered.
