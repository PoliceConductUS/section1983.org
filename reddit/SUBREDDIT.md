Section 1983 Pro Se Plaintiffs

## Description (500 char limit)

Pro se civil rights litigation against the government. Questions, strategy, experiences, and mutual support for people suing under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 without an attorney. The system is rigged — but you have a right to be in court, and you don't have to be there alone. Companion to section1983.org (coming soon).

## About / Sidebar

You got your rights violated by the government. You can't find a lawyer. The system is expensive, complex, and designed to exhaust you into giving up. You're here anyway.

This community is for **pro se plaintiffs** filing 42 U.S.C. § 1983 civil rights lawsuits in federal court. Ask questions. Share what worked. Warn others about what didn't. Discuss complaints, motions to dismiss, qualified immunity, discovery, settlement, and everything in between.

We are not lawyers. We are people who the system failed and who decided to fight back anyway.

**Companion site:** [section1983.org](https://section1983.org) (in development — a free, open-source survival guide for pro se § 1983 litigants)

### What is § 1983?

42 U.S.C. § 1983 is the federal statute that lets you sue government actors — including police officers, cities, and departments — for violating your constitutional rights. It covers:

- **Fourth Amendment** — unlawful arrest, excessive force, unreasonable search/seizure
- **First Amendment** — retaliation for speech, filming police, petitioning the government
- **Fourteenth Amendment** — due process violations, equal protection
- **Monell claims** — suing the city/department for unconstitutional policies, customs, or patterns
- **Conspiracy** — officers working together to violate your rights

### Who is this community for?

- People who've had their rights violated and are considering legal action
- Pro se plaintiffs currently in litigation
- People who've been through it and want to help others
- Law students, legal aid workers, and attorneys doing pro bono civil rights work
- Journalists and advocates covering police accountability
- Anyone who believes the justice system should be accessible to everyone, not just people who can afford lawyers

## Rules

### 1. This is not legal advice.

Nothing posted here constitutes legal advice. We are not attorneys (most of us). We share experiences, information, and strategies. **Your case is unique.** Use what you learn here as a starting point for your own research — not as a substitute for it. If you can find an attorney, consult one.

### 2. Be specific when asking for help.

"Is my case good?" with no details gets you nothing useful. Include:

- What happened (facts, not conclusions)
- When and where
- What stage you're at (pre-filing, complaint drafted, MTD received, etc.)
- What circuit/district you're in
- What you've already tried

The more specific you are, the better help you get.

### 3. No doxxing — yours or theirs.

- **Do not post** officers' home addresses, personal phone numbers, or family information. We're here to pursue legal accountability, not harassment.
- **Protect yourself.** Redact your own personal information (SSN, DOB, address, financial info) from any documents you share. Once it's on Reddit, it's public forever.
- Use pseudonyms or case numbers if you want to discuss specifics without identifying yourself.

### 4. Cite your sources.

If you're stating a legal rule, cite the case or statute. "I heard somewhere that..." doesn't help anyone. "Under _Tolan v. Cotton_, 572 U.S. 650 (2014), the court must view facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff at summary judgment" — that helps.

### 5. Be honest about uncertainty.

If you're not sure about something, say so. "I think this is how QI works in the 9th Circuit, but someone should verify" is infinitely better than stating wrong information as fact. Bad advice in this context can cost someone their case.

### 6. No case shaming.

Someone's case might look weak to you. It might actually be weak. But every person here had something happen to them that brought them to this point. You can honestly assess the legal merits without being cruel about it. "Your complaint has Iqbal problems — here's how to fix them" is constructive. "That's a garbage case, give up" is not.

### 7. Respect the fight.

Pro se litigation is brutally hard. People here are exhausted, scared, angry, and doing something most people never attempt. Respect that, even when you disagree with their approach. Offer alternatives, not insults.

### 8. No solicitation.

No advertising legal services, litigation funding, or paid products. Free resources (CourtListener, RECAP, legal aid referrals) are welcome. If you're an attorney offering genuine pro bono help, message the mods.

### 9. Defense attorneys are welcome — with transparency.

If you're a defense attorney or work for a municipal legal department, you're welcome to participate. But disclose it. Your perspective is valuable; hiding your position is not.

### 10. What happens in court stays in court (unless you choose to share).

Don't pressure anyone to reveal more about their case than they're comfortable sharing. Settlement confidentiality clauses may apply. Respect people's boundaries about what they can and can't discuss.

## Welcome Post

### Title: Welcome to r/Section1983_pro_se — Start Here

---

Hey everyone. I'm u/PoliceConductUS, a founding moderator of r/Section1983_pro_se.

If you're here, something happened to you — or someone you care about — that shouldn't have happened. And you're thinking about doing something about it.

This community exists for one reason: **no one should have to fight the government alone.**

42 U.S.C. § 1983 gives you the right to sue government actors — police officers, cities, departments — who violate your constitutional rights. But the system is built to make that as hard as possible: expensive, complex, and deliberately exhausting. Most pro se § 1983 cases are dismissed. That's by design.

We're here to improve those odds.

### What to Post

Anything the community would find useful, honest, or encouraging:

- **"Do I have a case?"** — Describe what happened (be specific) and get real feedback
- **Complaint drafts** — Share your draft and get it stress-tested before you file
- **MTD responses** — Got hit with a motion to dismiss? Post it and let's break it down together
- **Discovery questions** — Interrogatories, document requests, deposition strategy
- **Qualified immunity research** — Finding (or not finding) clearly established law in your circuit
- **Wins, settlements, and losses** — Share outcomes so others can learn from them
- **Lessons learned** — What you wish you'd known when you started
- **Resources** — Free tools, case law, guides, anything that helps
- **Questions at any level** — There are no stupid questions here. Everyone started at zero.

### Community Vibe

We're not a law firm. We're people who the system failed and who decided to fight back anyway.

Be **honest** — if someone's complaint has problems, tell them. That's how they survive the MTD.
Be **respectful** — everyone here is doing something hard. Critique the filing, not the person.
Be **specific** — "cite your sources" isn't just a rule, it's how we build trust.

We don't do false hope. We don't do case shaming. We do real talk about a rigged system and how to navigate it anyway.

### How to Get Started

1. **Introduce yourself** in the comments below — where you are in the process, what brought you here
2. **Read the rules** (sidebar) — especially 1-3
3. **Post something today.** A question, an update, a resource you found. Even "I just got arrested and I don't know what to do" is a valid first post. That's why we're here.
4. **Know someone who needs this?** Send them our way.

### Companion Site: section1983.org (Coming Soon)

We're building **[section1983.org](https://section1983.org)** — a free, open-source survival guide for pro se § 1983 litigants. It'll cover everything from writing your complaint to surviving trial, with templates, case law databases, circuit-specific guides, and an AI tool that checks your citations against real court records.

It's still in development. This community is where we help each other in the meantime — and after it launches, this is where the conversations happen that a static site can't have.

### Free Resources You Can Use Right Now

- **[CourtListener](https://www.courtlistener.com)** — free case law search (millions of opinions)
- **[RECAP Extension](https://free.law/recap)** — install this before you ever touch PACER. It frees documents for everyone.
- **[RECAP Archive](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/)** — search PACER documents others have already freed
- **[Google Scholar - Case Law](https://scholar.google.com)** — select "Case law" for free case search
- **[Cornell LII](https://www.law.cornell.edu)** — free statutes, rules, and legal encyclopedia
- **[GovInfo](https://www.govinfo.gov)** — free federal court opinions

### One More Thing

You have a constitutional right to access the courts. You have a right to represent yourself. You are not a nuisance. You are not a crank. You are a citizen exercising the most fundamental check on government power — holding them accountable when they violate your rights.

The system makes that hard on purpose. We're here to make it a little less hard.

**Interested in helping moderate?** Reach out to me directly. We're looking for people who've been through the process and want to help others navigate it.

Welcome. Let's get to work.

## Welcome DM (sent 1 hour after joining)

**Subject:** Welcome to r/Section1983_pro_se

Hey — welcome. Whatever brought you here, you're in the right place.

A few things to get you started:

**If you're figuring out whether you have a case:**
Post what happened. Use the ❓ Basic Question or 📋 Complaint Help flair. Be specific — what happened, when, where, what circuit you're in. The more detail you give, the better feedback you'll get.

**If you're already in litigation:**
Jump in wherever you are. We have flairs for every stage — MTD response, discovery, settlement, all of it. Share what you're facing. Chances are someone here has been through it.

**If you're here to help others:**
Thank you. Answer questions, share resources, review someone's draft. Every person who helps here is making the system a little less rigged.

**Three things to know:**

1. **This is not legal advice.** We share experiences and information. Your case is unique — verify everything independently.
2. **Protect yourself.** Redact personal info from any documents you share. Don't post anything your opposing counsel could use against you.
3. **Free tools that will save you money and time:**
   - [CourtListener](https://www.courtlistener.com) — free case law search
   - [RECAP Extension](https://free.law/recap) — install this before you ever log into PACER
   - [Google Scholar Case Law](https://scholar.google.com) — select "Case law"

We're also building **section1983.org** — a free survival guide for pro se § 1983 litigants. It's not live yet, but it's coming.

You have a right to be in court. You don't have to be there alone.

## Wiki Stub (for later)

The subreddit wiki should eventually mirror key sections of section1983.org:

- "Do I Have a Case?" quick assessment
- Circuit-by-circuit QI guide
- Complaint checklist
- MTD response framework
- Template library links
- Free resource directory
- Glossary of legal terms

Build this out as section1983.org develops — the wiki should point to the site, not duplicate it.
