# No Lawyer Will Take My Case. Now What?

**Flair:** Reality Check / Strategy

**Post date:** Day 5 (Feb 22)

You called ten firms. Twenty. Some didn't call back. The ones who did said your case wasn't "big enough" or asked for a retainer you can't afford. One said "qualified immunity" like it was a terminal diagnosis.

This is the most common experience for people with valid § 1983 claims. It doesn't mean your case is bad. It means the economics don't work for contingency-fee attorneys unless the damages are substantial — usually meaning serious physical injury or death.

### Why attorneys pass on § 1983 cases

It's not personal. It's math:

- **Qualified immunity** makes the outcome unpredictable even with strong facts
- **Cities fight hard** because admitting liability sets precedent
- **Discovery is expensive** — depositions, experts, document review
- **Juries are unpredictable** on damages, especially without visible physical injury
- **Cases take 1–3 years** — that's a long time for an attorney to work without getting paid

An attorney evaluating your case on contingency is essentially asking: "Is there a 60%+ chance I'll recover at least $100K?" If the answer isn't clearly yes, most pass.

### Your options

**1. File pro se.** This is what this sub is about. You represent yourself. It's hard, but it's your right, and federal courts are required to construe pro se filings liberally. You won't get a handicap on the law, but you won't be dismissed just for not having a JD.

**2. File pro se, then find counsel later.** Some attorneys won't take a case pre-filing but will step in after you survive a motion to dismiss. At that point, you've proven the case has legs and the settlement calculus changes.

**3. Contact legal aid or civil rights organizations.** The ACLU, local legal aid societies, and law school clinics sometimes take § 1983 cases. Don't just call once — try multiple chapters and keep a log.

**4. Don't sue — but still document.** Report your experience on [policeconduct.org](https://policeconduct.org). Your report creates a public record that helps researchers, journalists, and future plaintiffs.

### The honest truth

Pro se litigation against a city with taxpayer-funded attorneys is not a fair fight. You'll be outresourced at every turn. But "not fair" and "not possible" are different things. Pro se plaintiffs win cases. Not often, but it happens — and every case that survives to discovery gives you leverage to settle.
