If you're new here, this is the foundation. Everything else in this sub builds on it.

### The statute

42 U.S.C. § 1983 was passed during Reconstruction in 1871. It says, in plain terms: if a government employee violates your constitutional rights while acting under the authority of their position, you can sue them in federal court for damages.

That's it. It doesn't create new rights — it gives you a way to enforce the ones you already have.

### What it covers

Section 1983 is the vehicle for suing over:

- **False arrest** (Fourth Amendment) — arrested without probable cause
- **Excessive force** (Fourth Amendment) — force that wasn't reasonable under the circumstances
- **First Amendment retaliation** — arrested, charged, or harassed because you criticized police, recorded them, or exercised your right to petition
- **Due process violations** (Fourteenth Amendment) — fabricated evidence, malicious prosecution, unconstitutional conditions of confinement
- **Conspiracy** — multiple government actors coordinating to violate your rights

### Who you can sue

- **Individual officers** — in their personal ("individual") capacity. This is how you get past sovereign immunity.
- **Cities and counties** — under *Monell v. Department of Social Services*. But only if you can show the violation resulted from an official policy, custom, or deliberate indifference (like failure to train).
- **NOT the state.** The Eleventh Amendment blocks § 1983 suits against states. Also not federal officers (that's a *Bivens* action, which is mostly dead).

### Who you can't sue

- **Police departments** — in most jurisdictions, the department isn't a suable entity. Sue the city.
- **Prosecutors** — absolute immunity for actions taken in their prosecutorial role
- **Judges** — absolute immunity for judicial acts
- **The state itself** — Eleventh Amendment

### The catch

**Qualified immunity.** Officers are immune from damages unless the right they violated was "clearly established" at the time. In practice, this means you need a prior court decision with substantially similar facts. It's the biggest barrier in § 1983 litigation and the subject of its own deep dive post (coming tomorrow).
