# What Actually Happens After You File Your § 1983 Complaint

**Flair:** Process / Guide

**Post date:** Day 3 (Feb 20)

---

You filed. The clerk accepted it. Maybe you felt relief, maybe terror, maybe both. Now what?

Here's the timeline nobody explains to pro se plaintiffs up front.

### 1. Service (Days 1–90)

You have to formally serve each defendant. This isn't optional and it's not automatic. The court won't do it for you unless you're proceeding IFP and request a waiver of service under Rule 4(d). You have 90 days. Miss it and your case can be dismissed.

### 2. The Wait (Weeks 1–8)

After service, defendants have 21 days to respond (60 if they waived service). Usually they ask for extensions. The court usually grants them. This is normal and not a sign of anything.

### 3. The Motion to Dismiss (Months 2–4)

This is where most pro se cases get tested for the first time. Defendants almost always file a Rule 12(b)(6) motion arguing your complaint fails to state a claim. They'll raise qualified immunity here too.

You'll get 21 days to respond. This response is arguably the most important document you'll file in the entire case. Take every day they give you.

### 4. The Magistrate Judge's FCR

In many districts, a magistrate judge handles pretrial matters and issues a Findings, Conclusions, and Recommendation (FCR) on the motion to dismiss. You then have 14 days to file objections before the district judge rules.

Read the FCR carefully. If claims are dismissed without prejudice, you can amend. If with prejudice, you'll need to appeal.

### 5. Discovery (Months 4–12+)

If you survive the MTD, you enter discovery. This is where you get to demand documents, take depositions, and request admissions. It's also where the city's lawyers will try to bury you in procedure.

### 6. Summary Judgment (Months 8–18)

After discovery, defendants will almost certainly move for summary judgment. This is their second shot at ending the case before trial. Now qualified immunity gets litigated on a full factual record, not just the complaint.

### 7. Trial or Settlement (Months 12–24+)

Very few § 1983 cases reach trial. Most settle after summary judgment, if they survive that long. The settlement offer is usually a fraction of what your claim is worth, bundled with a confidentiality agreement and no admission of wrongdoing.

### The reality

Start to finish, a § 1983 case takes 1–3 years. There are long stretches of silence, sudden bursts of deadline pressure, and constant uncertainty. Knowing the roadmap won't make it easy, but it helps you stop panicking every time something happens.
