# You Will Probably Lose. You Might Sue Anyway. Here's Why That Still Matters.

**Flair:** Strategy / Reality Check

---

I wrote something I wish someone had handed me before I filed my § 1983 case.

It's an honest breakdown of what you're actually walking into as a pro se plaintiff:

- **Qualified immunity** — not just "first officer gets a pass." Every officer gets a pass forever until a court in your circuit says otherwise. And after _Pearson v. Callahan_, courts can dismiss without ever reaching the constitutional question — so the right never gets established. The loop just repeats. Meanwhile, _you're_ presumed to know every law on the books. The cops — professionally trained in the law — only have to follow the ones a court has already spelled out for them.

- **Iqbal/Twombly** — your complaint has to be specific enough to survive, but those same specific facts get used against you in the QI analysis. Too vague? Dismissed. Too specific and your facts don't match a prior case? Not clearly established. Dismissed. With real examples of complaints that failed and complaints that survived (spoiler: most of the survivors still lost later).

- **Discovery, settlement math, judicial bias, timeline, fee-shifting** — all the things nobody tells you until you're already in it.

Then it gets into _why you might do it anyway_: every case creates a public record, and public records are how patterns become visible. Your case might be the data point that makes the next Monell claim or DOJ investigation possible.

And how documenting on [policeconduct.org](https://policeconduct.org) makes your case findable — by researchers, journalists, and the next person that officer does this to — even if you lose.

The full article cites real cases with real outcomes — and we're working on making the original district court complaints freely available on [CourtListener](https://www.courtlistener.com) so you can read the actual filings, not just the appellate opinions.

### You don't have to sue. You should still document it.

Most people shouldn't file a § 1983 lawsuit. The deck is stacked, the cost is enormous, and the odds are terrible. That's the honest truth.

But you can still make what happened to you matter.

**[Report your experience on policeconduct.org](https://policeconduct.org)** — good or bad. You don't need a lawyer. You don't need to file anything with a court. You just need to write down what happened.

Think about it the way you'd review any other professional. You review your doctor. Your lawyer. Your mechanic. Your kid's teacher. Every one of those reviews helps the next person make a better decision. Police officers are public servants with the power to take your freedom, hurt you, or kill you — and they're the _one_ profession with no public review system.

Your report helps:

- **Other departments** looking to hire that officer — right now, problem officers move from department to department because nobody tracks them publicly
- **Lawyers** evaluating § 1983 claims involving serious injury or death — your "minor" interaction might be the pattern evidence that makes someone else's case
- **Researchers and journalists** documenting systemic problems
- **The next person** who gets pulled over by that officer and wants to know what they're dealing with

You don't have to sue. You probably shouldn't. But don't let what happened to you disappear.
