# Your Complaint Is Your Foundation — Don't Rush It

**Flair:** Strategy / Writing

**Post date:** Day 4 (Feb 21)

The biggest mistake pro se plaintiffs make isn't filing too late or picking the wrong defendants. It's filing a complaint they wrote in a weekend because they were angry.

I get it. You want to be heard. You want the court to know what happened. But your complaint isn't a letter to the judge — it's a legal document that determines whether your case lives or dies at the 12(b)(6) stage.

### What the court actually needs from your complaint

After *Ashcroft v. Iqbal* and *Bell Atlantic v. Twombly*, your complaint must contain:

1. **Factual allegations** — specific, non-conclusory facts about what each defendant did
2. **Plausibility** — enough factual content that the court can draw a "reasonable inference" the defendant is liable
3. **Each element of each claim** — you need to plead every element. Miss one, that claim gets dismissed.

"The officers violated my Fourth Amendment rights" is a legal conclusion. The court ignores it. Instead: "On December 4, 2023, Officer Smith grabbed Plaintiff by the arm, forced him to the ground face-first, and handcuffed him, despite Plaintiff standing still with his hands visible and making no threatening movements."

### Common mistakes

- **Naming departments instead of individuals.** Police departments usually aren't suable entities. Name the officers and the city.
- **Lumping defendants together.** "Defendants violated Plaintiff's rights" doesn't tell the court who did what. Each defendant's personal participation must be alleged separately.
- **Forgetting Monell.** If you're suing the city, you need a separate theory — custom, policy, failure to train, or ratification. The city isn't liable just because its employee violated your rights.
- **Skipping the timeline.** Judges love chronology. Dates, times, sequence of events. It makes your story credible and your allegations specific.

### Take your time

You have up to two years from the incident in most states (check your state's statute of limitations for personal injury). Use that time. Read complaints that survived motions to dismiss. Read complaints that didn't. Learn the difference.

Your complaint sets the ceiling on your entire case. Everything that comes after — discovery, summary judgment, trial — is bounded by what you put in that document. Build it right.

### Discussion

What's one thing you wish you'd known before you filed your complaint?
