# Welcome to r/Section1983_pro_se — What This Sub Is For

If you're here, something probably happened to you that shouldn't have. Maybe the police arrested you without cause. Maybe they used force that wasn't justified. Maybe you spoke up and they retaliated. And now you're thinking about suing — or you already filed — and you can't find a lawyer who'll take your case.

You're not alone. This sub exists for you.

### What this community is

A place for **pro se plaintiffs** — people representing themselves — in 42 U.S.C. § 1983 civil rights lawsuits in federal court. That means:

- Asking questions about procedure, strategy, and what to expect
- Sharing what's working in your case (and what isn't)
- Discussing complaints, motions to dismiss, qualified immunity, discovery, settlement
- Supporting each other through a process designed to make you quit

### What this community is not

- **Not a place for legal advice.** Nobody here is your lawyer. We share experiences and information, not professional counsel.
- **Not anti-police by default.** It's pro-accountability. There's a difference.
- **Not a place to dox anyone.** Discuss cases and legal issues, not personal vendettas.

### Resources

We're building a free survival guide at **[section1983.org](https://section1983.org)** — 370+ pages covering cases, legal terms, the litigation process, and practical articles. All free, no paywall, no registration.

If you have a question, there's a good chance the answer is there. If it's not, ask here and we'll figure it out together.

### Rules of the road

1. Be honest about what you know and don't know
2. Cite your sources when you can
3. Don't pretend to be a lawyer if you aren't one
4. Help the next person — if you learned something the hard way, write it down

Welcome. The system is hard. You don't have to navigate it alone.
