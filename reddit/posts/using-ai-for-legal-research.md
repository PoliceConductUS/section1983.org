# Using AI for Legal Research in Your § 1983 Case (Without Getting Sanctioned)

**Flair:** Tools / Strategy

You've probably heard the horror stories. Attorneys citing cases that don't exist because ChatGPT made them up. Judges issuing sanctions. It's real, and it should scare you.

But AI tools — used correctly — can be genuinely useful for pro se plaintiffs who can't afford Westlaw or a research attorney. The key is knowing what AI is good at, what it's bad at, and how to verify everything.

### What AI can do for you

- **Explain legal concepts in plain language.** "What is Monell liability?" is a great prompt. The explanation will be 90% correct and save you hours of reading law review articles.
- **Summarize long opinions.** Paste in a court opinion and ask for the holding, the facts, and the legal standard. Then read the original to verify.
- **Find search terms.** If you describe your situation, AI can suggest relevant legal doctrines, case names, and search queries for Google Scholar or CourtListener.
- **Draft outlines.** Not final documents — but structural outlines for complaints, responses, and briefs.
- **Check your writing.** Paste your draft and ask "does this comply with Iqbal plausibility pleading?" or "have I alleged personal participation for each defendant?"

### What AI cannot do for you

- **Cite cases reliably.** AI hallucinates citations. Every single case name, citation, and holding must be verified on Google Scholar, CourtListener, or a court's PACER system. No exceptions.
- **Know your local rules.** Every district has local rules that override general federal procedure. AI doesn't know that N.D. Tex. requires X-page briefs or that your magistrate judge wants Y format.
- **Replace reading the actual opinions.** Summaries are starting points. The court will hold you to what the case actually says, not what AI told you it says.

### The verification rule

**If you can't find it on Google Scholar or CourtListener, it doesn't exist.** Period. Do not cite anything in a filing that you have not personally read and verified. Judges have zero tolerance for fabricated citations, and being pro se won't protect you.
