# Qualified Immunity Explained Without the Spin

Qualified immunity is the reason most § 1983 cases die. Not because the officer did nothing wrong — but because no court has previously said that *this specific* wrong was wrong in *this specific* way.

Here's how it actually works, stripped of the political framing from both sides.

### The two-part test

After *Pearson v. Callahan* (2009), courts ask:

1. Did the officer violate a constitutional right?
2. Was that right "clearly established" at the time?

Courts can address these in either order — or skip question 1 entirely. That's the trap. If a court jumps straight to "not clearly established" without deciding whether a violation occurred, the right *never gets established*. The next plaintiff faces the same gap.

### What "clearly established" actually means

It doesn't mean "a reasonable person would know this is wrong." It means a prior court decision — usually in your circuit — already addressed substantially similar facts and found a violation.

The Supreme Court in *Ashcroft v. al-Kidd* said you need a case with facts specific enough that "every reasonable official" would have understood their conduct violated the law. General principles of law rarely suffice.

So an officer can:
- Arrest you without probable cause
- Use force that wasn't necessary
- Retaliate against your speech

...and still get immunity if they did it in a way that hasn't been previously litigated in your federal circuit.

### Why this matters for you

If you're filing pro se, qualified immunity is likely the first serious obstacle you'll face — usually in a motion to dismiss or at summary judgment. Your complaint needs to do more than describe what happened. It needs to connect your facts to existing case law showing the right was clearly established.

That's hard. But it's not impossible. Start here:

### Discussion

For those of you currently litigating: how has qualified immunity come up in your case? Did the defendants raise it in a 12(b)(6), at summary judgment, or both? What cases did you cite to overcome it?
