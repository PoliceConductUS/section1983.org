# section1983.org — User Stories

_Every story starts with someone who got hurt by the government and doesn't know what to do next._

---

## The First Visit — "What Just Happened to Me?"

- As someone who was just arrested/beaten/had my rights violated, I want to understand whether what happened to me was illegal, so I know if I have a case.
- As someone in crisis, I want information in plain language — not legalese — so I can understand it without a law degree.

## Do I Have a Case? — "Is This Worth Fighting?"

- As someone who was arrested but charges were dropped, I want to understand what that means for a civil case, so I know my options.

- As someone whose incident happened over a year ago, I want to know if I've run out of time (statute of limitations) and whether anything tolls the clock, so I can act before it's too late.
- As someone who was hurt by police but not badly enough for a hospital visit, I want to understand what damages I can claim so I know if the case is worth the fight.
- As someone who experienced retaliation for filming police, I want to know if that's a recognized constitutional violation in my circuit, so I can decide whether to proceed.

- As someone whose family member was killed by police, I want to understand wrongful death § 1983 claims and who has standing to file, so I can pursue justice for someone who can't.

## Can I Afford This? — "I Don't Have Money for a Lawyer"

- As someone who can't afford a lawyer, I want to know exactly what it costs to file pro se and how to get fees waived (IFP), so money isn't the reason I don't try.

- As someone who can't afford a process server, I want to know that the U.S. Marshal will serve my defendants for free if I'm IFP, so service doesn't become a barrier.

## Before I File — "How Do I Prepare?"

- As someone about to file a lawsuit, I want a checklist of everything I should do BEFORE filing — FOIA requests, evidence preservation, body cam requests — so I don't lose access to critical evidence.
- As someone who doesn't know what FOIA is, I want a plain-language guide to requesting public records from the police department, so I can get the data I need.

- As someone researching the officers who arrested me, I want to know how to look up their TCOLE/POST records, complaint history, and involvement in prior lawsuits, so I can build my case around their track record.

## Writing My Complaint — "How Do I Say This?"

- As someone who knows what happened but doesn't know how to write it legally, I want help translating my experience into numbered factual paragraphs that a court can work with, so my complaint survives a motion to dismiss.
- As someone who's angry, I want the site to help me channel that anger into precise factual allegations instead of emotional narrative, so the court takes me seriously.
- As someone who writes "the cop grabbed me up for no reason," I want to see how to say the same thing in court language — "Officer Doe seized Plaintiff without probable cause" — while understanding WHY the second version works better.
- As someone drafting a complaint, I want to stress-test it against the most common MTD arguments (12(b)(6), QI, Monell failure) BEFORE filing, so I can fix weaknesses before the defense exploits them.
- As someone who doesn't know what Iqbal/Twombly means, I want a plain-language explanation of why "the officer violated my rights" gets thrown out but "the officer grabbed my throat and slammed my head on the hood" doesn't, so I understand the standard I'm writing to.
- As someone who has more evidence than I know what to put in the complaint, I want guidance on what to include and what to hold back for later, so I don't show my whole hand on day one.

- As someone who doesn't know what "relief" means, I want help understanding what I can ask the court for — money, policy changes, an apology, an admission — so I know what winning looks like.

## Filing — "How Does This Actually Work?"

- As someone who's never been in a federal courthouse, I want a step-by-step guide to filing a complaint — from the civil cover sheet to ECF to service of process, so I don't get tripped up by paperwork.
- As someone filing IFP, I want to know exactly what information the court needs about my finances and what the application looks like, so I'm not embarrassed or surprised.
- As someone who doesn't know what ECF/CM is, I want a walkthrough of the electronic filing system, so I can file my documents without calling the clerk in a panic.
- As someone filing in a specific district, I want the local rules for that district — page limits, font, margins, filing deadlines — so I don't get my filing struck for the wrong font size.
- As someone who needs to serve the City of Irving (or any city), I want to know exactly who to serve and how, so I don't waste my 90-day service window on the wrong person.
- As someone who filed a complaint, I want to understand what happens next — screening, scheduling order, initial disclosures, the defendant's response deadline — so I'm not blindsided.

## Facing the MTD — "They're Trying to Kill My Case"

- As someone who just got served with a motion to dismiss, I want to understand what it is and what it means without panicking, so I can respond effectively.
- As someone who needs to respond to an MTD, I want a framework for structuring my response that mirrors the defense's exact headings, so the judge can read them side by side.
- As someone facing a qualified immunity argument, I want to find cases with facts similar to mine where QI was denied, so I can cite them in my response.
- As someone facing a Monell challenge, I want to point to the prior lawsuits, complaint records, and policy failures I gathered in pre-filing investigation, so I can show the pattern is real.
- As someone whose MTD response is due in 14 days, I want a template and checklist — not a law review article — so I can produce something the court can work with under deadline pressure.
- As someone who suspects the city filed a template MTD (the same brief they use in every case), I want to know how to identify template reuse and use it against them, so their laziness becomes evidence of a pattern.
- As someone who lost on the MTD, I want to understand the difference between "with prejudice" and "without prejudice" and what my options are — amend, object to FCR, appeal — so I know it's not necessarily over.
- As someone who received an FCR recommending dismissal, I want to understand that I have 14 days to file specific objections and that failing to object means the recommendation becomes the ruling, so I don't lose by default.
- As someone whose MTD was converted to summary judgment because the defense attached outside materials, I want to understand what happened and how to invoke Rule 56(d) to get time for discovery, so I'm not ambushed.

## Discovery — "Now I Get to Find Out What They're Hiding"

- As someone who survived the MTD, I want to know what discovery tools are available — interrogatories, RFPs, RFAs, depositions — and which to use first, so I can build my evidentiary record.
- As someone writing interrogatories, I want sample questions specific to § 1983 police misconduct cases, so I'm asking the right things.
- As someone whose discovery requests are being stonewalled with boilerplate objections, I want to know how to file a Motion to Compel with a chart showing each request and why the objection fails, so the court forces them to respond.
- As someone preparing for a deposition, I want to know how to question an officer about inconsistencies between their report and the body camera footage, so I can lock them into testimony I can impeach later.
- As someone who discovered the defense destroyed evidence (deleted body cam, lost records), I want to know about spoliation sanctions and adverse inference instructions, so the destruction works against them, not me.
- As someone receiving thousands of pages of document production, I want strategies for organizing and finding the relevant evidence buried in the dump, so I'm not overwhelmed.

## Dealing with the Other Side — "Their Lawyer Is Playing Games"

- As someone whose opposing counsel keeps requesting extensions, I want to know when to agree (almost always) and how to create a record showing the pattern of delay, so I maintain the moral high ground while protecting my interests.
- As someone who received a Rule 11 threat letter, I want to understand that it's often a scare tactic, what the 21-day safe harbor means, and how to respond professionally, so I don't panic or cave.
- As someone being painted as "unreasonable" in filings, I want to understand that the narrative game is part of the defense strategy and that staying professional is the best counter, so I don't take the bait.
- As someone who needs to communicate with opposing counsel, I want guidelines for professional correspondence — tone, format, always in writing, always follow up — so every interaction is documented and reflects well on me.
- As someone who was contacted by opposing counsel offering to "talk informally," I want to know how to handle it — be polite, take notes, follow up in writing, don't make admissions — so I'm not manipulated.

## In Court — "I've Never Done This Before"

- As someone attending my first hearing, I want to know what to wear, how to address the judge, when to stand, when to speak, and what to bring, so I don't undermine my case with bad courtroom etiquette.
- As someone arguing a motion before the judge, I want to know how oral argument works — how long I have, how to structure my points, how to respond to questions — so I'm prepared.
- As someone facing cross-examination, I want tips on staying calm, answering only the question asked, and not volunteering information, so the defense can't rattle me.
- As someone whose judge seems hostile to my case, I want to understand that some judges have patterns and that preserving objections for appeal is critical, so I protect my rights even when the courtroom doesn't feel fair.
- As a pro se litigant in a room with experienced defense attorneys, I want to feel like I belong there — because I do, and the Constitution says so.

## Settlement — "They Want to Make This Go Away"

- As someone who received a settlement offer, I want to understand what it means, what the terms actually say, and what I'm giving up by accepting, so I make an informed decision.
- As someone who was offered money with a confidentiality clause, I want to understand that I can reject the gag order and still negotiate the dollar amount, so I don't trade my story for a check.
- As someone who cares more about change than money, I want to know I can demand policy changes, an admission of wrongdoing, or a public apology as conditions of settlement, so the next person doesn't go through what I did.
- As someone under financial pressure, I want an honest assessment of whether the offer is fair relative to my damages and the cost of continuing, so I'm not exploited but also not leaving money on the table.
- As someone considering settlement, I want to understand that confidentiality clauses hide the pattern — and that rejecting them means the next plaintiff can find my case and use it, so I can make a choice that serves the common good.
- As someone who wants to settle but keep the right to speak publicly, I want to know exactly which terms to reject and how to negotiate them out, so silence isn't the price of resolution.

## After It's Over — "Now What?"

- As someone who won my case, I want to understand attorney's fees, cost recovery, and how to file a fee petition, so I recoup what I can.
- As someone who lost, I want to understand my appeal options, deadlines (30 days!), and what "preserving issues" means, so I don't lose my right to challenge the ruling.
- As someone whose case revealed a pattern of misconduct, I want to know how to share my evidence with the DOJ, advocacy organizations, and journalists, so my case contributes to broader reform.
- As someone who went through this, I want to help the next person — contribute my experience, share what I learned, review others' complaints — so the community gets stronger.
- As someone who settled with transparency, I want my case to be findable on this site, so other people suing the same department can learn from it.

## Using the Site's Tools

- As someone drafting a filing, I want to upload my document and have EyeCite check every citation — verified, format issue, or not found — so I don't file a brief citing a case that doesn't exist.
- As someone who used AI to help draft my complaint, I want the site to verify every AI-generated citation against CourtListener before I file, so I don't get sanctioned for hallucinated cases.
- As someone who wants to find cases similar to mine, I want to search by claim type (4A arrest, 1A retaliation, excessive force), circuit, and outcome (survived MTD, won at trial), so I find the precedent I need.
- As someone researching my judge, I want to see their § 1983 ruling history — grant/deny rates on MTDs, QI decisions, pro se case outcomes — so I know what to expect.
- As someone who doesn't know what circuit I'm in, I want to enter my state and have the site tell me my circuit and its specific rules, so I don't have to figure out the federal court system map.
- As someone who needs a template, I want downloadable, fillable templates for complaints, IFP applications, civil cover sheets, MTD responses, and discovery requests, so I have a starting point that's correctly formatted.
- As someone who found a helpful PACER document but can't afford it, I want to post a request ("prayer for a document") and have someone with RECAP pull it so it's freed to CourtListener, so cost doesn't block my research.
- As someone with PACER access, I want to know that installing RECAP means every document I view gets freed for others, so I can help while doing my own research.

## The AI Bot — "Talk to Me Like a Person"

- As someone who doesn't know where to start, I want to describe what happened to me in plain language and have the bot help me identify potential claims, so I don't need to know the legal framework first.
- As someone who drafted a complaint, I want the bot to attack it the way a defense attorney would — flag conclusory statements, QI vulnerabilities, Monell gaps — so I can strengthen it before filing.
- As someone who received an MTD, I want to paste it and have the bot help me understand each argument and suggest responses grounded in real case law, so I'm not guessing at the law.
- As someone who speaks Spanish/Mandarin/Arabic, I want the bot to communicate in my language while producing output in court-ready English, so language isn't a barrier to justice.
- As someone who just wants to vent, I want the bot to listen, acknowledge what I'm going through, and gently redirect to actionable steps, so I feel heard without wasting time.
- As someone who's been told by ChatGPT that I have a great case (when I might not), I want this bot to be honest with me about weaknesses, not just tell me what I want to hear, so I make real decisions based on real analysis.

## Accessibility and Inclusion

- As a person with a visual disability, I want the site to be screen-reader accessible, so I can navigate it independently.
- As someone with limited internet access (library, phone data), I want the site to load fast and work on slow connections, so I can use it even without great infrastructure.
- As someone in jail or prison (pre-trial or post-conviction), I want printable versions of the guides, so I can access them even without internet.
- As someone who learns better by listening than reading, I want audio versions of key sections, so I can absorb the material in the way that works for me.
- As someone whose first language isn't English, I want at least the critical sections (Do I Have a Case, Complaint Builder, MTD Response) available in Spanish, so the 41 million native Spanish speakers in the US can access justice too.
- As someone who's overwhelmed by the amount of information, I want a "start here" flow that asks me 5-10 questions and points me to exactly the sections I need, so I don't have to read everything to find what's relevant.

## Community

- As a pro se litigant who survived an MTD, I want to share my response as a model for others, so my hard work helps the next person.
- As someone suing the same department someone else already sued, I want to find their case, their filings, their outcome, so I'm building on what came before instead of starting from scratch.
- As an attorney who does pro bono § 1983 work, I want to find litigants whose cases have merit but need help, so I can contribute where it matters most.
- As a law student, I want to use this site to learn practical civil rights litigation, so I'm prepared to help people when I graduate.
- As a journalist covering police misconduct, I want access to the case database and pattern evidence, so I can tell stories that drive accountability.
